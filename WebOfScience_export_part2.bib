Abstract = {Object detection, which aims at recognizing or locating the objects of
   interest in remote sensing imagery with high spatial resolutions (HSR),
   plays a significant role in many real-world scenarios, e.g., environment
   monitoring, urban planning, civil infrastructure construction, disaster
   rescuing, and geographic image retrieval. As a long-lasting challenging
   problem in both machine learning and geoinformatics communities, many
   approaches have been proposed to tackle it. However, previous methods
   always overlook the abundant information embedded in the HSR remote
   sensing images. The effectiveness of these methods, e.g., accuracy of
   detection, is therefore limited to some extent. To overcome the
   mentioned challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel two-phase deep
   framework, dubbed GLGOD-Net, to effectively detect meaningful objects in
   HSR images. GLGOD-Net firstly attempts to learn the enhanced deep
   representations from super-resolution image data. Fully utilizing the
   augmented image representations, GLGOD-Net then learns the fused
   representations into which both local and global latent features are
   implanted. Such fused representations learned by GLGOD-Net can be used
   to precisely detect different objects in remote sensing images. The
   proposed framework has been extensively tested on a real-world HSR image
   dataset for object detection and has been compared with several strong
   baselines. The remarkable experimental results validate the
   effectiveness of GLGOD-Net. The success of GLGOD-Net not only advances
   the cutting-edge of image data analytics, but also promotes the
   corresponding applicability of deep learning in remote sensing imagery.},

Title = {Monitoring Land Subsidence in Wuhan City (China) using the SBAS-InSAR
   Method with Radarsat-2 Imagery Data},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Abstract = {Wuhan city is the biggest city in central China and has suffered
   subsidence problems in recent years because of its rapid urban
   construction. However, longtime and wide range monitoring of land
   subsidence is lacking. The causes of subsidence also require further
   study, such as natural conditions and human activities. We use small
   baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)
   method and high-resolution RADARSAT-2 images acquired between 2015 and
   2018 to derive subsidence. The SBAS-InSAR results are validated by 56
   leveling benchmarks where two readings of elevation were recorded. Two
   natural factors (carbonate rock and soft soils) and three human factors
   (groundwater exploitation, subway excavation and urban construction) are
   investigated for their relationships with land subsidence. Results show
   that four major areas of subsidence are detected and the subsidence rate
   varies from -51.56 to 27.80 millimeters per year (mm/yr) with an average
   of -0.03 mm/yr. More than 83.81\% of persistent scattered (PS) points
   obtain a standard deviation of less than -6 mm/yr, and the difference
   between SBAS-InSAR method and leveling data is less than 5 mm/yr. Thus,
   we conclude that SBAS-InSAR method with Radarsat-2 data is reliable for
   longtime monitoring of land subsidence covering a large area in Wuhan
   city. In addition, land subsidence is caused by a combination of natural
   conditions and human activities. Natural conditions provide a basis for
   subsidence and make subsidence possible. Human activities are driving
   factors and make subsidence happen. Moreover, subsidence information
   could be used in disaster prevention, urban planning, and hydrological
   modeling.},

Abstract = {Smart city has been becoming nowadays a very popular topic that not only
   in developed countries but also in developing countries. There are
   variety of definitions for smart city in different fields and regions.
   Generally, it aims for a sustainable city development through the
   optimal management of the resources and potential, offering a
   comprehensively higher quality life to the citizens. The planning of
   area energy system is one of the most important issues, which is related
   to the energy generation, the energy consumption by facilities,
   transportation system, and any other city infrastructures. Especially
   for Japan, one of the countries facing the complex issues of an aging
   society, disaster management and energy dependency need a new
   methodologies for optimal urban energy planning that integrates all
   information from these sectors. Smart city with highly developed
   information and communications technology (ICT) is considered as such an
   important approach. To encourage the smart city concept in Japan, this
   paper proposes a ``GIS-BIM{''} based urban energy planning system to
   access the optimal technical and policy solution for readjust city
   infrastructure beyond the integrated analysis. Firstly, it introduces
   the concept of Japanese smart city which covers from urban planning to
   infrastructure. Secondly, the research proposes a GIS-BIM based urban
   energy planning system including the database construction and analysis
   by GIS, the optimal energy system design aided by BIM and 3D
   visualization with user-friendly interface. Finally, center of Tokyo is
   adopted as a case study, suggesting the potential to access the optimal
   technical and policy solution. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Urban social vulnerability assessment with physical proxies and spatial
   metrics derived from air- and spaceborne imagery and GIS data},

Abstract = {Risk management in urban planning is of increasing importance to
   mitigate the growing amount of damage and the increasing number of
   casualties caused by natural disasters. Risk assessment to support
   management requires knowledge about present and future hazards, elements
   at risk and different types of vulnerability. This article deals with
   the assessment of social vulnerability (SV). In the past this has
   frequently been neglected due to lack of data and assessment
   difficulties. Existing approaches for SV assessment, primarily based on
   community-based methods or on census data, have limited efficiency and
   transferability. In this article a new method based on contextual
   analysis of image and GIS data is presented. An approach based on proxy
   variables that were derived from high-resolution optical and laser
   scanning data was applied, in combination with elevation information and
   existing hazard data. Object-oriented image analysis was applied for the
   definition and estimation of those variables, focusing on SV indicators
   with physical characteristics. A reference Social Vulnerability Index
   (SVI) was created from census data available for the study area on a
   neighbourhood level and tested for parts of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. For
   the evaluation of the proxy-variables, a stepwise regression model to
   select the best explanatory variables for changes in the SVI was
   applied. Eight out of 47 variables explained almost 60\% of the
   variance, whereby the slope position and the proportion of built-up area
   in a neighbourhood were found to be the most valuable proxies. This work
   shows that contextual segmentation-based analysis of geospatial data can
   substantially aid in SV assessment and, when combined with field-based
   information, leads to optimization in terms of assessment frequency and
   cost.},

Title = {Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Tensor Train for Change Detection in
   Multitemporal Hyperspectral Images},

Abstract = {Remote sensing change detection (CD) using multitemporal hyperspectral
   images (HSIs) provides detailed information on spectral-spatial changes
   and is useful in a variety of applications such as environmental
   monitoring, urban planning, and disaster detection. However, the high
   dimensionality and low spatial resolution of HSIs do not only lead to
   expensive computation but also bring about inter-class homogeneity and
   inner-class heterogeneity. Meanwhile, labeled samples are difficult to
   obtain in reality as field investigation is expensive, which limits the
   application of supervised CD methods. In this paper, two algorithms for
   CD based on the tensor train (TT) decomposition are proposed and are
   called the unsupervised tensor train (UTT) and self-supervised tensor
   train (STT). TT uses a well-balanced matricization strategy to capture
   global correlations from tensors and can therefore effectively extract
   low-rank discriminative features, so the curse of the dimensionality and
   spectral variability of HSIs can be overcome. In addition, the two
   proposed methods are based on unsupervised and self-supervised learning,
   where no manual annotations are needed. Meanwhile, the ket-augmentation
   (KA) scheme is used to transform the low-order tensor into a high-order
   tensor while keeping the total number of entries the same. Therefore,
   high-order features with richer texture can be extracted without
   increasing computational complexity. Experimental results on four
   benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods outperformed their
   tensor counterpart, the tucker decomposition (TD), the higher-order
   singular value decomposition (HOSVD), and some other state-of-the-art
   approaches. For the Yancheng dataset, OA and KAPPA of UTT reached as
   high as 98.11\% and 0.9536, respectively, while OA and KAPPA of STT were
   at 98.20\% and 0.9561, respectively.},

Abstract = {Gridded population datasets are essential for displaying spatial
   distributions of residential populations. They are widely used in urban
   planning, decision-making, disaster assessment, and public health.
   However, the grid resolution may affect the accuracy of population
   distributions, and this issue should be further explored to obtain a
   clearer understanding. Therefore, it is crucial to determine appropriate
   grid sizes for ascertaining the spatial characteristics of population
   distributions on a large scale. The choice of the grid resolution for a
   population dataset generally depends on the source datasets and the
   requirements of a specific project. While previous studies on grid
   resolutions were conducted predominantly in small study areas, this
   study focused primarily on the population distribution of the whole of
   China at 14 different scales, from 100 m to 1 km (with a 100-m
   interval), and from 1 km to 5 km (with a 1-km interval). Population
   spatialization was conducted using census data from 351 cities in China
   at the city level and impervious surface data derived from satellite
   images. Dasymetric mapping method was employed to estimate the
   population distribution, and the scale effects of the population
   estimates were examined at different scales of impervious surface data.
   The results of an accuracy assessment of the population estimates using
   county-level census data demonstrated that the impervious surface data
   were useful and effective when estimating residential populations with
   dasymetric mapping. The scale effects had varying degrees of accuracy of
   the estimated populations derived at different scales of impervious
   surface data, and a scale of 2-4 km was deemed optimal for estimating
   the residential population distribution based on impervious surfaces
   while using the dasymetric mapping method.},

   Assessment: Evidence from a Satellite Town of Shenzhen Metropolitan Area},

Abstract = {Land suitability assessment is fundamental in space control planning and
   land development because of its effects on land use and urban layout.
   Rainstorms and waterlogging have become one of the most common natural
   disasters in the coastal areas of China. As a result, the concept of an
   ecological sponge city was incorporated into the construction of cities
   in the future. Taking Shenzhen-Shantou special cooperation zone (SSCZ),
   we constructed a storm flooding model based on the SCS flow generation
   model and GIS to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of the
   flooding risk in a rainstorm of 100-year lasting 1 h. Combined with
   population and economic indicators, a radial basis function (RBF)
   network was utilized to evaluate the environmental risk, the
   vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies, and the rain-flood resilience
   of sponge cities. The self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM) model was
   used for cluster analysis. Spatial differences were found in the
   construction suitability of the study area. A suitable construction area
   (73.59\% of the entire area) was located downtown. The construction of
   the artificial spongy body in the highest vulnerable area (3.25\%) needs
   to be strengthened. The control construction area (3.3\%) is located
   along the banks of the river, with relatively high risk and low
   resilience of flood control engineering. Ecological construction
   (19.85\%) serves as the sponge body of ecological buffer. The factors of
   waterlogging, ecology, population, and economy could be integrated
   comprehensively by applying neural network methods for urban planning
   and construction.},

Title = {Coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles for 3D terrain
   reconstruction},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional terrain reconstruction from 2D aerial images is a
   problem of utmost importance due its wide level of applications. It is
   relevant in the context of intelligent systems for disaster managements
   (for example to analyze a flooded area), soil analysis, earthquake
   crisis, civil engineering, urban planning, surveillance and defense
   research.
   It is a two level problem, being the former the acquisition of the
   aerial images and the later, the 3D reconstruction. We focus here in the
   first problem, known as coverage path planning, and we consider the case
   where the camera is mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
   In contrast with the case when ground vehicles are used, coverage path
   planning for a UAV is a lesser studied problem. As the areas to cover
   become complex, there is a clear need for algorithms that will provide
   good enough solutions in affordable times, while taking into account
   certain specificities of the problem at hand. Our algorithm can deal
   with both convex and non-convex areas and their main aim is to obtain a
   path that reduces the battery consumption, through minimizing the number
   of turns.
   We comment on line sweep calculation and propose improvements for the
   path generation and the polygon decomposition problems such as coverage
   alternatives and the interrupted path concept. Illustrative examples
   show the potential of our algorithm in two senses: ability to perform
   the coverage when complex regions are considered, and achievement of
   better solution than a published result (in terms of the number of turns
   used). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mapping fine-scale population distributions at the building level by

Abstract = {Fine-scale population distribution data at the building level play an
   essential role in numerous fields, for example urban planning and
   disaster prevention. The rapid technological development of remote
   sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) in recent decades
   has benefited numerous population distribution mapping studies. However,
   most of these studies focused on global population and environmental
   changes; few considered fine-scale population mapping at the local
   scale, largely because of a lack of reliable data and models. As
   geospatial big data booms, Internet-collected volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) can now be used to solve this problem. This article
   establishes a novel framework to map urban population distributions at
   the building scale by integrating multisource geospatial big data, which
   is essential for the fine-scale mapping of population distributions.
   First, Baidu points-of-interest (POIs) and real-time Tencent user
   densities (RTUD) are analyzed by using a random forest algorithm to
   down-scale the street-level population distribution to the grid level.
   Then, we design an effective iterative building-population gravity model
   to map population distributions at the building level. Meanwhile, we
   introduce a densely inhabited index (DII), generated by the proposed
   gravity model, which can be used to estimate the degree of residential
   crowding. According to a comparison with official community-level census
   data and the results of previous population mapping methods, our method
   exhibits the best accuracy (Pearson R=.8615, RMSE=663.3250, p<.0001).
   The produced fine-scale population map can offer a more thorough
   understanding of inner city population distributions, which can thus
   help policy makers optimize the allocation of resources.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) systems have been collecting massive volumes of
   datasets for decades, managing and analyzing of which are not practical
   using common software packages and desktop computing resources. In this
   regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google
   Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data
   analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo
   data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of
   time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its
   high potential for different applications, it has not been fully
   investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years.
   Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects
   of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions,
   advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450
   journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May
   2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets
   were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine
   learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to
   image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range
   of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology,
   urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image
   processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE
   publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and
   it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different
   fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.},

Abstract = {Landslides constitute the most widespread and damaging natural hazards
   in the Constantine city. They represent a significant constraint to
   development and urban planning. In order to reduce the risk related to
   potential landslide, there is a need to develop a comprehensive
   Landslide Hazard Map (LHM) of the area for an efficient disaster
   management and for planning development activities. The purpose of this
   research is to prepare and compare the Landslide Hazard Maps (LHMs) of
   the Constantine city, by applying Frequency Ratio (FR), Weighting factor
   (Wf), Logistic Regression (LR), Weights Of Evidence (WOE) and Analytical
   Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods used in a framework of the Geographical
   Information System (GIS). Firstly, a landslide inventory map has been
   prepared based on the interpretation of aerial photographs, high
   resolution satellite images, fieldwork and available literature.
   Secondly, eight landslide-conditioning factors such as lithology, slope,
   exposure, rainfall, land use, distance to drainage, distance to road and
   distance to fault have been considered to establish LHMs using the FR,
   Wf, LR, WOE and AHP models in GIS. For verification, the obtained LHMs
   have been validated comparing the LHMs with the known landslide
   locations using the Receiver Operating Characteristics curves (ROC). The
   validated results indicate that the FR method provides more accurate
   prediction (86.59\%) of LHMs than the WOE (82.38\%), AHP (77.86\%), Wf
   (77.58\%), and LR (70.45\%) models. On the other hand, the obtained
   results showed that all the used models in this study provided a good
   accuracy in predicting landslide hazard in Constantine city. The
   established maps can be used as useful tools for risk prevention and
   landuse planning in the Constantine region.},

Abstract = {With the advent of a large number of remote sensing images (RSIs), scene
   classification of RSI is widely applied to many fields such as urban
   planning, natural disaster detection, and environmental monitoring.
   Compared with the natural image field, the lack of labeled RSI is a
   bottleneck of supervised scene classification methods based on deep
   learning. Meanwhile, unsupervised scene classification is difficult to
   meet actual needs. To this end, we propose a novel semisupervised scene
   classification method for RSI using generative adversarial nets (GANs),
   in which a gating unit, a self-attention gating (SAG) module, and a
   pretrained Inception V3 branch are introduced into discriminative
   network to enhance the feature representation capability for
   facilitating semisupervised classification. To be specific, the gating
   unit aims to learn the weights of each feature map and capture the
   dependence relationship between features. The SAG module aims to capture
   a long-range dependence for adaptively focusing on important scene
   regions. The Inception V3 branch aims to extract the high-level semantic
   representation of input images and further enhance the discriminant
   ability by gating unit and SAG module. Furthermore, a new optimization
   term is incorporated into the generator loss to indirectly drive
   discriminator to correctly classify scene images. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experimental results on
   UC Merced and EuroSAT data sets demonstrate that the method surpasses
   most of the state-of-the-art semisupervised image classification methods
   significantly, especially when only few samples are tagged.},

Abstract = {Social housing is nowadays more connected to economy and politics than
   issues related to designing and architecture. This discrepancy is a
   problem of the modern philosophy of designing housing estates and social
   housing. The concept of housing and social housing as well as its
   axiological elements, resulting from its program content and guidelines
   seem to be an inspirational basis for solving contemporary problems of
   shaping the housing tissue in the postmodern world. An important goal is
   to strike a balance between social, economic and political issues. This
   particular balance can be reached by designing solutions leading to
   eliminate or decrease the ``uncertainty{''} of the existence of local
   communities, including the possibility of creating and providing jobs in
   the broader sense of social participation. The above reflection is
   connected with the philosophy of designing public estates and social
   housing in Poland as well as in Europe. What is more, it seems that
   postmodern societies require the creation of new programming conditions,
   housing standards and housing estates. Architectural and urban planning
   solutions for buildings / social settlements currently implemented in
   Polish conditions are preliminary in nature. The search for functional
   and program solutions as well as formal and aesthetic solutions is in
   progress. In addition, in the design of buildings and social housing
   estates, the eco-energetic postulate gains importance. Global warming,
   which in the perspective means a civilizational disaster in the world
   must find its reflection in the search for new solutions in the field of
   design, including, and perhaps even primarily in the design of buildings
   and social housing estates. Such solutions can ensure not only the right
   quality of housing and housing developments, but also generate
   additional jobs related to eco-energy. According to the above, it is
   necessary to create new design concepts.},

Abstract = {Climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) can inform adaptation
   policy and help in incorporating climate futures in planning. The
   literature on CCVA stems from a number of research paradigms (e.g., risk
   assessment, natural disaster management, and urban planning), therefore
   making it difficult to extract major directions and methodologies from
   this body of work. A large number of assessments are based, partly or
   totally, on indicators which bring up specific methodological problems
   and constraints. In this study, first, we discuss the most important
   methodological challenges facing indicator-based vulnerability
   assessment (IBVA) based on a set of key conceptual papers in the field.
   Second, we conduct a meta-analysis of a representative sample of
   peer-reviewed IBVA studies, to identify how current research on IBVA is
   engaging with these challenges. We attempt to elicit major thematic and
   methodological trends in this corpus with specific focus on issues
   related to geographical and temporal scales, aggregation, and
   nonlinearity. We find that health of ecosystems and biodiversity (28\%),
   freshwater quantity and quality (12\%), and public health (10\%) have
   attracted the highest number of studies. Less than a third of the papers
   in our sample give some consideration to uncertainty and nonlinearity.
   Assessments typically use aggregation methods that are based on the
   Multiple Attribute Utility Theory despite the fact that IBVA rarely
   satisfies the theoretical requirements of this approach. A small
   percentage of IBVA studies critically scrutinize prevalent assessment
   methodologies or attempt to develop new ones, despite the raised
   questions in key theoretical papers about its methodological aspects.

Abstract = {The paper analyses news from the Zagreb press and the archival sources
   (from institutions of the Croatian Provincial Government and the City of
   Zagreb) on how the damaged buildings were repaired immediately after the
   earthquake that struck Zagreb on November 9, 1880. The focus is on the
   intensity of construction activity and the issues that arose in relation
   to the construction and urban planning shortly after the natural
   disaster, during 1881.
   As it was a strong earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.1-6.3 on the
   Richter scale, and as Zagreb was a small town with 28,360 inhabitants,
   almost no buildings were left undamaged and a considerable number of
   buildings had to be torn down partially or completely.
   Due to the fear of new earthquakes, the damaged buildings were repaired
   primarily so as to strengthen them. Iron clasps were installed in walls
   and roofs, the intense use of iron beams, and the construction of
   thicker firewalls and gable walls, reinforced with pylons, was
   recommended. In addition to iron, concrete was now increasingly used in
   architecture.
   Numerous alterations and additions to the existing buildings, frequently
   of poor quality, were declared the main culprit for the collapse of
   parts of buildings in the earthquake, as their structures could not
   withstand the weight of the added floors.
   Floating staircases, which largely collapsed or became dangerous to use,
   proved to be a great problem, so after the earthquake they were
   reinforced with various types of iron beams or pillars, or were
   completely rebuilt. Another problem were the vertical decorations on the
   roofs of buildings, pedestals, sculptures, and balustrades, especially
   if they were not firmly attached with iron clamps to the structural
   parts. Although it was recommended to use them less, such decorations
   remained a specificity of Zagreb's architecture in the coming decades.
   Part of the intellectual elite of Zagreb and Croatia, specifically the
   politician and first Croatian art historian Iso Krsnjavi and Josip Juraj
   Strossmayer, Bishop of Dakovo, realized that the natural disaster that
   had struck Zagreb was also an extraordinary opportunity for quality
   reconstruction and the future flourishing of the city. They believed
   that the earthquake had further emphasized the need to restore Zagreb's
   medieval monuments. Krsnjavi encouraged the use of decorations attached
   to the construction, i.e. the construction of fronts made of facade
   bricks and wooden ceilings inside buildings that were uncovered with
   plaster, but his incentives had only limited success.
   After the basic rebuilding of the city was completed by the end of 1880,
   during 1881 major repairs of the damaged buildings continued, along with
   new constructions. A large number of lavish residential and
   residential-commercial buildings were erected, of which the Baumgartner
   and Prister houses in the central city square, Ban Jelacic Square, and
   the Vranyczany house on today's Strossmayer Square stand out. The
   construction of the Baumgartner house raised the issue of designing the
   northern side of Ban Jelacic Square, where the construction of two- and
   three-storey buildings with variously shaped fronts was planned.
   The earthquake also raised the issue of urban transformation of the old
   part of the city, widening its streets and squares, and correcting the
   street routes, but due to lack of funds, only minor interventions
   (removal of individual buildings) were carried out during 1881.
   Although many plans remained unrealized, the earthquake of November 9,
   1880 served as a catalyst for change in the history of Zagreb's
   architecture and urban planning.},

Abstract = {The construction of urban shelters is one of the most important work in
   urban planning and disaster prevention. The spatial allocation
   assessment is a fundamental pre-step for spatial location-allocation of
   urban shelters. This paper introduces a new method which makes use of
   agent-based technology to implement evacuation simulation so as to
   conduct dynamic spatial allocation assessment of urban shelters. The
   method can not only accomplish traditional geospatial evaluation for
   urban shelters, but also simulate the evacuation process of the
   residents to shelters. The advantage of utilizing this method lies into
   three aspects: (1) the evacuation time of each citizen from a
   residential building to the shelter can be estimated more reasonably;
   (2) the total evacuation time of all the residents in a region is able
   to be obtained; (3) the road congestions in evacuation in sheltering can
   be detected so as to take precautionary measures to prevent potential
   risks. In this study, three types of agents are designed: shelter
   agents, government agents and resident agents. Shelter agents select
   specified land uses as shelter candidates for different disasters.
   Government agents delimitate the service area of each shelter, in other
   words, regulate which shelter a person should take, in accordance with
   the administrative boundaries and road distance between the person's
   position and the location of the shelter. Resident agents have a series
   of attributes, such as ages, positions, walking speeds, and so on. They
   also have several behaviors, such as reducing speed when walking in the
   crowd, helping old people and children, and so on. Integrating these
   three types of agents which are correlated with each other, evacuation
   procedures can be simulated and dynamic allocation assessment of
   shelters will be achieved. A case study in Jing'an District, Shanghai,
   China, was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. A
   scenario of earthquake disaster which occurs in nighttime was set to
   simulate the evacuation process of the residents to the earthquake
   shelter candidates in the study area. The simulation results convinced
   that the proposed method can better evaluate the spatial configuration
   of urban shelter than traditional GIS methods. The method can help local
   decision-makers preferably handle shelter planning and emergency
   evacuation management problems. It can also be extended to conduct
   similar assessment work in other urban regions for different kinds of
   shelters.},

Title = {Resilience assessment of complex urban systems to natural disasters: A
   new literature review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {311-330},

Abstract = {In parallel with the observed greater frequency of natural disasters
   worldwide, there has been an ever-increasing interest in urban
   resilience and its assessment. Experience obtained in recent extreme
   events (in particular, earthquakes and floods) has revealed that both
   the level of preparedness and the response of affected cities were
   insufficiently high, whereas the recovery process was long and
   expensive. For this reason improved pre-disaster mitigation actions, as
   well as smart and strategic urban planning in threatened areas (e.g. in
   earthquake-prone regions), is essential. For this purpose, a
   comprehensive review of the existing literature has been performed in
   relation to the holistic assessment of urban system resilience to
   natural disasters, with an emphasis on the effect of earthquakes. The
   main goal of the review was to try to determine how to best assess the
   resilience of urban systems as a whole, taking into account all of their
   components, i.e. both the physical components (i.e. of buildings,
   infrastructure, and open spaces) and the social components (i.e. of the
   community), as well as the dynamic interactions between them. Besides
   considering the commonly measured indicators (e.g. determination of the
   scope of actual structural damage caused by an earthquake), the paper
   tries to extend the discussion to some indicators which are not so
   commonly taken into account, by applying a quantitative resilience
   assessment approach. Based on the results of the described new
   literature review, a preliminary concept which could be used to assess
   the seismic resilience of complex urban systems, taking into account all
   urban components which have been identified as having an important
   impact on the latter, is presented. This concept consists of three
   different parts: (i) a probabilistic fragility analysis for each
   individual physical element (i.e. a building or an infrastructure
   element), (ii) a composite index methodology for the measurement of
   community disaster resilience, and (iii) a complex network approach
   (graph theory) for the assessment of the resilience of urban systems as
   a whole. Since, in the existing literature, there is a lack of
   consideration of urban open space, which can have a significant role in
   the recovery process, it is suggested that, in future research of
   seismic resilience assessment, such open space should be taken into
   account, and that an in-depth study of possible recovery strategies be
   performed.},

Abstract = {Automatic building extraction is an important topic for many
   applications such as urban planning, disaster management, 3D building
   modeling and updating GIS databases. Its approaches mainly depend on two
   data sources: light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud and aerial
   imagery both of which have advantages and disadvantages of their own. In
   this study, in order to benefit from the advantages of each data
   sources, LiDAR and image data combined together. And then, the building
   boundaries were extracted with the automated active contour algorithm
   implemented in MATLAB. Active contour algorithm uses initial contour
   positions to segment an object in the image. Initial contour positions
   were detected without user interaction by a series of image
   enhancements, band ratio and morphological operations. Four test areas
   with varying building and background levels of detail were selected from
   ISPRS's benchmark Vaihingen and Istanbul datasets. Vegetation and
   shadows were removed from all the datasets by band ratio to improve
   segmentation quality. Subsequently, LiDAR point cloud data was converted
   to raster format and added to the aerial imagery as an extra band.
   Resulting merged image and initial contour positions were given to the
   active contour algorithm to extract building boundaries. In order to
   compare the contribution of LiDAR to the proposed method, the boundaries
   of the buildings were extracted from the input image before and after
   adding LiDAR data to the image as a layer. Finally extracted building
   boundaries were smoothed by the Awrangjeb (Int J Remote Sen 37(3):
   551-579. 10.1080/01431161.2015.1131868, 2016) boundary regularization
   algorithm. Correctness (Corr), completeness (Comp) and accuracy (Q)
   metrics were used to assess accuracy of segmented building boundaries by
   comparing extracted building boundaries with manually digitized building
   boundaries. Proposed approach shows the promising results with over 93\%
   correctness, 92\% completeness and 89\% quality.},

Abstract = {Seismic microzonation and earthquake loss estimation scenarios are
   needed for city planning, disaster preparedness, risk reduction and
   hazard mitigation decisions, and urban rehabilitation actions in
   earthquake prone areas. Loss estimation due to earthquakes in an urban
   environment is a very complex process that requires detailed building
   inventories, realistic estimation of earthquake characteristics on the
   ground surface and comprehensive assessment of building vulnerabilities.
   The earthquake hazard is spatially distributed in relation to earthquake
   sources that need to be assessed based on the regional seismotectonic
   scale and local site conditions. Mapping the variation in earthquake
   hazard at an urban scale makes it possible to select relatively less
   affected zones for the allocation of appropriate land use. Urban
   development patterns can be oriented toward these relatively less
   affected zones to minimize possible earthquake damages. The three
   principal factors controlling earthquake loss are earthquake source
   characteristics, site response and structural features. The seismic
   microzonation maps would indicate the distribution of site response with
   respect to ground shaking intensity, liquefaction and landslide
   susceptibility; thus providing an input for urban planning and
   earthquake mitigation priorities at an urban scale. It is also possible
   to estimate building damage and causalities based on microzonation maps
   used as an input to earthquake damage scenarios. These estimates may be
   very approximate and may not always be on the conservative side based on
   the accuracy of the input data and methods of analyses. However, they
   can also be more realistic and more accurate when more comprehensive
   data and more sophisticated analysis methods are implemented. Thus one
   of the important issues is the estimation of the needed accuracy and
   corresponding level of complexity in the analytical studies. The results
   obtained using different levels of seismic hazard and site
   characterisation data will be summarised very briefly to demonstrate the
   importance of the comprehensive site characterisation as well as the
   procedures used to estimate site effects for different levels of seismic
   hazard based on case studies conducted in Istanbul.},

Abstract = {The success of personal mobile communication technologies has led an
   emerging expansion of the telecommunication infrastructure but also to
   an explosion to mobile broadband data traffic as more and more people
   completely rely on their mobile devices, either for work or
   entertainment. The continuously interaction of their mobile devices with
   the mobile network infrastructure creates digital traces that can be
   easily logged by the network operators. These digital traces can be
   further used, apart from billing and resource management, for
   large-scale population monitoring using mobile traffic analysis. They
   could be integrated into intelligent systems that could help at
   detecting exceptional events such as riots, protests or even at disaster
   preventions with minimal costs and improve people safety and security,
   or even save lives. In this paper we study the use of fully anonymized
   and highly aggregate cellular network data, like Call Detail Records
   (CDRs) to analyze the telecommunication traffic and connect people,
   locations and events. The results show that by analyzing the CDR data
   exceptional spatio-temporal patterns of mobile data can be correlated to
   real-world events. For example, high user network activity was mapped to
   religious festivals, such as Ramadan, Le Grand Magal de Touba and the
   Tivaouane Maouloud festival. During the Ramadan period it was noticed
   that the communication pattern doubled during the night with a slow
   start during the morning and along the day. Furthermore, a peak increase
   in the number of voice calls and voice calls duration in the area of
   Kafoutine was mapped to the Casamance Conflict in the area which
   resulted in four deaths. Thus, these observations could be further used
   to develop an intelligent system that detects exceptional events in
   real-time from CDRs data monitoring. Such system could be used in
   intelligent transportation management, urban planning, emergency
   situations, network resource allocation and performance optimization,
   etc. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Extraction of urban objects, and analysis of two- and three-dimensional
   (2D and 3D) morphological parameters, as well as 2D and 3D landscape
   metrics in urban environments are valuable for updating GIS databases
   and for civic applications, urban planning, disaster risk assessment,
   and climate and sustainability studies. However, few studies have
   reported the extraction of 3D buildings at different scales in urban
   areas or developed a method for accuracy evaluation. This study aims at
   developing a method of multi-scale 3D building information extraction
   (MS3DB) to fill this research gap. Surface flatness and the variance in
   the normal direction were extracted from the point cloud data, and
   gray-level co-occurrence matrix was extracted from normalized digital
   surface models as labeling features, which were fused into a graph-cut
   the algorithm to determine building labeling. In addition, 2D and 3D
   building morphological parameters were extracted at the grid-scale, and
   a set of 3D building landscape metrics were designed at the city-block
   scale. Accuracy of the extraction of 3D building information was
   evaluated at the object, grid, and block scales. The model achieved high
   accuracy in extracting the building labels using data from the northern
   part of Brooklyn, New York, USA. The results show that the MS3DB method
   yields limited accuracy in extracting the building edges, whereas other
   parameters (e.g., area, volume, and planar area index) were extracted
   with high accuracy at the grid scale (R-2 > 0.92). The block-scale
   landscape analysis shows the advantages of integrating 2D and 3D
   features (e.g., differences in the vertical landscape) in characterizing
   the structure of urban buildings and exhibits moderate accuracy (R-2 >
   0.79).},

Title = {The Effects of Spatial Planning, Well-Being, and Behavioural Changes
   During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {COVID-19 poses a massive challenge to urban public-health emergency and
   governance systems. Urban planners and policymakers engaged in spatial
   planning and management should carefully consider how a
   ``people-oriented{''} principle can be incorporated into
   spatial-planning systems to reduce the negative impacts on both cities
   and people. However, there is limited literature discussing the
   aforementioned issues, particularly using qualitative methods.
   Therefore, this research aims to explore the implications of COVID-19 on
   spatial planning, well-being, and behavioural change using Changchun as
   a case study. Semi-structured interviews are used to examine the views
   and insights of 23 participants. Our results show that, first, the shift
   to home working has changed people's way of life, affected their
   subjective well-being, and significantly affected spatial planning
   within cities, placing greater demands on architectural design and
   community spatial planning. Therefore, additional open public spaces and
   a more supportive infrastructure are required. Second, it is found that
   Changchun has not established an effective community-based spatial
   planning system, something which should have been taken into
   consideration in the master plan for the future. Third, our findings
   suggest that being a resilient city is vital for the sustainable
   development of second-tier cities like Changchun, which is reflected in
   urban development patterns, disaster prevention, and long-term
   functional layout, among other aspects. This study contributes to the
   existing literature on resilient cities, particularly from the
   perspective of sustainability with regard to resilience to and recovery
   from major urban crises. In terms of policy implications, planning
   departments should work with public health and public safety departments
   to formulate guidelines and management rules in order to improve the
   spatial planning of cities during periods of extraordinary change and
   challenge.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of space technology, space remote sensing
   activities get a full extension and application. Remote sensing
   information has become an essential part of geographic information data
   source. As a very important kind of geographic information in remote
   sensing information, road information has a wide range of applications
   in the field of traffic navigation, urban planning, and military
   reconnaissance. To acquire road information accurately and rapidly is
   the only way to meet the needs of practical application. But due to the
   high complexity of remote sensing information of the road, and the
   modern computer automation has not yet reached the level of the
   corresponding demand, so far there is still not a mature and reliable
   automatic road extraction method, so the automatic road extraction
   technology has become a research hotspot in remote sensing information
   processing. This paper presents an automatic algorithm based on fuzzy
   connectedness which can extract road information from the remote sensing
   images. The algorithm detects the edge of the image with Canny operator
   and connected domain elimination. Then extend the road with the fuzzy
   connectedness to form a road image. After using fuzzy connectedness
   expansion algorithm, the automatic identification of the road can be
   achieved. In many trials of treating remote sensing images as objects,
   the performance of this extraction algorithm has high accuracy and
   greater versatility. The results of the experiment are in line with
   basic human identification results. Road information is critical to the
   public when disaster comes, having a full knowledge of the road
   information may help reducing the casualties. As a result, road
   extraction is vital to the safety of our citizens as well as our
   government's emergency warning, preparedness and planning. Road
   extraction has great significance in the earthquake relief and forest
   fire escape, thus plays an important role in emergency rescue and relief
   work.},

Title = {Mapping Multi-Temporal Population Distribution in China from 1985 to
   2010 Using Landsat Images via Deep Learning},

Abstract = {Fine knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of the population is
   fundamental in a wide range of fields, including resource management,
   disaster response, public health, and urban planning. The United
   Nations' Sustainable Development Goals also require the accurate and
   timely assessment of where people live to formulate, implement, and
   monitor sustainable development policies. However, due to the lack of
   appropriate auxiliary datasets and effective methodological frameworks,
   there are rarely continuous multi-temporal gridded population data over
   a long historical period to aid in our understanding of the
   spatiotemporal evolution of the population. In this study, we developed
   a framework integrating a ResNet-N deep learning architecture,
   considering neighborhood effects with a vast number of Landsat-5 images
   from Google Earth Engine for population mapping, to overcome both the
   data and methodology obstacles associated with rapid multi-temporal
   population mapping over a long historical period at a large scale. Using
   this proposed framework in China, we mapped fine-scale multi-temporal
   gridded population data (1 km x 1 km) of China for the 1985-2010 period
   with a 5-year interval. The produced multi-temporal population data were
   validated with available census data and achieved comparable
   performance. By analyzing the multi-temporal population grids, we
   revealed the spatiotemporal evolution of population distribution from
   1985 to 2010 in China with the characteristic of concentration of the
   population in big cities and the contraction of small- and medium-sized
   cities. The framework proposed in this study demonstrates the
   feasibility of mapping multi-temporal gridded population distribution at
   a large scale over a long period in a timely and low-cost manner, which
   is particularly useful in low-income and data-poor areas.},

Title = {Building Footprint Extraction from High Resolution Aerial Images Using
   Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Architecture},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {209517-209527},
Abstract = {Building extraction with high accuracy using semantic segmentation from
   high-resolution remotely sensed imagery has a wide range of applications
   like urban planning, updating of geospatial database, and disaster
   management. However, automatic building extraction with non-noisy
   segmentation map and obtaining accurate boundary information is a big
   challenge for most of the popular deep learning methods due to the
   existence of some barriers like cars, vegetation cover and shadow of
   trees in the high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Thus, we introduce
   an end-to-end convolutional neural network called Generative Adversarial
   Network (GAN) in this study to tackle these issues. In the generative
   model, we utilized SegNet model with Bi-directional Convolutional LSTM
   (BConvLSTM) to generate the segmentation map from Massachusetts building
   dataset containing high-resolution aerial imagery. BConvLSTM combines
   encoded features (containing of more local information) and decoded
   features (containing of more semantic information) to improve the
   performance of the model even with the presence of complex backgrounds
   and barriers. The adversarial training method enforces long-range
   spatial label vicinity to tackle with the issue of covering building
   objects with the existing occlusions such as trees, cars and shadows and
   achieve high-quality building segmentation outcomes under the complex
   areas. The quantitative results obtained by the proposed technique with
   an average F1-score of 96.81\% show that the suggested approach could
   achieve better results through detecting and adjusting the difference
   between the segmentation model output and the reference map compared to
   other state-of-the-art approaches such as autoencoder method with
   91.36\%, SegNet+BConvLSTM with 95.96\%, FCN-CRFs with 95.36\%\% SegNet
   with 94.77\%, and GAN-SCA model with 96.36\% accuracy.},

Abstract = {Floods always have been a natural disasters and it is very difficult to
   stop flood destruction and apply required preventive measures without
   any pre-prediction. Remote sensing and GIS tool like Global flood
   monitoring system (GFMS) and HEC-RAS model provide the idea to analyze
   the flood analysis and their potential. The purpose of this study was to
   model the water surface elevation (WSE) of river Yamuna at district
   Allahabad near Sangam area, Uttar Pradesh, India by using the one of the
   latest flood monitoring tool (GFMS) which provides near real time
   discharge value of various streams of the world. In this study three
   stations were selected for calibration of the model, at present these
   stations are also being used by various government organizations of
   India for river stage monitoring. HEC-RAS modeling was carried out for
   determine flood events or WSE/HFL (High Flood Level) of the year 1978
   and 2001-2014. After that, the modeled output data was compared with
   real observed data and no significance difference in most of the cases
   was observed. The findings of HEC-RAS modeling indicate that
   applicability of this model can play the effective role to predict flood
   potential and identify the WSE in future for making the plan for any
   city situated near the river. In this regard, WSE level for upcoming
   100, 500 and 1000 years was estimated by Gumbel's distribution method
   and found maximum stage 89.367, 90.568 and 92.268 m, respectively, above
   from mean sea level. Further, this study indicates that a larger area
   nearby the study area falls in highly risky zone and plan for safety
   management is needed. This methodology can be used for urban planning
   and disaster management for various cities situated near the rivers in
   the world.},

Title = {Compound flood potential from storm surge and heavy precipitation in
   coastal China: dependence, drivers, and impacts},

Abstract = {The interaction between storm surge and concurrent precipitation is
   poorly understood in many coastal regions. This paper investigates the
   potential compound effects from these two flooding drivers along the
   coast of China for the first time by using the most comprehensive
   records of storm surge and precipitation. Statistically significant
   dependence between flooding drivers exists at the majority of locations
   that are analysed, but the strength of the correlation varies spatially
   and temporally and depending on how extreme events are defined. In
   general, we find higher dependence at the south-eastern tide gauges
   (TGs) (latitude < 30 degrees N) compared to the northern TGs. Seasonal
   variations in the dependence are also evident. Overall there are more
   sites with significant dependence in the tropical cyclone (TC) season,
   especially in the summer. Accounting for past sea level rise further
   increases the dependence between flooding drivers, and future sea level
   rise will hence likely lead to an increase in the frequency of compound
   events. We also find notable differences in the meteorological patterns
   associated with events where both drivers are extreme versus events
   where only one driver is extreme. Events with both extreme drivers at
   south-eastern TG sites are caused by low-pressure systems with similar
   characteristics across locations, including high precipitable water
   content (PWC) and strong winds that generate high storm surge. Based on
   historical disaster damages records of Hong Kong, events with both
   extreme drivers account for the vast majority of damages and casualties,
   compared to univariate flooding events, where only one flooding driver
   occurred. Given the large coastal population and low capacity of
   drainage systems in many Chinese urban coastal areas, these findings
   highlight the necessity to incorporate compound flooding and its
   potential changes in a warming climate into risk assessments, urban
   planning, and the design of coastal infrastructure and flood defences.},

Abstract = {This study presents an overview of seismic microzonation and existing
   methodologies with a newly proposed methodology covering all aspects.
   Earlier seismic microzonation methods focused on parameters that affect
   the structure or foundation related problems. But seismic microzonation
   has generally been recognized as an important component of urban
   planning and disaster management. So seismic microzonation should
   evaluate all possible hazards due to earthquake and represent the same
   by spatial distribution. This paper presents a new methodology for
   seismic microzonation which has been generated based on location of
   study area and possible associated hazards.
   This new method consists of seven important steps with defined output
   for each step and these steps are linked with each other. Addressing one
   step and respective result may not be seismic microzonation, which is
   practiced widely. This paper also presents importance of geotechnical
   aspects in seismic microzonation and how geotechnical aspects affect the
   final map. For the case study, seismic hazard values at rock level are
   estimated considering the seismotectonic parameters of the region using
   deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. Surface level
   hazard values are estimated considering site specific study and local
   site effects based on site classification/characterization.
   The liquefaction hazard is estimated using standard penetration test
   data. These hazard parameters are integrated in Geographical Information
   System (GIS) using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and used to estimate
   hazard index. Hazard index is arrived by following a multi-criteria
   evaluation technique - AHP, in which each theme and features have been
   assigned weights and then ranked respectively according to a consensus
   opinion about their relative significance to the seismic hazard.
   The hazard values are integrated through spatial union to obtain the
   deterministic microzonation map and probabilistic microzonation map for
   a specific return period. Seismological parameters are widely used for
   microzonation rather than geotechnical parameters. But studies show that
   the hazard index values are based on site specific geotechnical
   parameters.},

Abstract = {Remote Sensing (RS) has been used in urban mapping for a long time;
   however, the complexity and diversity of urban functional patterns are
   difficult to be captured by RS only. Emerging Geospatial Big Data (GBD)
   are considered as the supplement to RS data, and help to contribute to
   our understanding of urban lands from physical aspects (i.e., urban land
   cover) to socioeconomic aspects (i.e., urban land use). Integrating RS
   and GBD could be an effective way to combine physical and socioeconomic
   aspects with great potential for high-quality urban land use
   classification. In this study, we reviewed the existing literature and
   focused on the state-of-the-art and perspective of the urban land use
   categorization by integrating RS and GBD. Specifically, the commonly
   used RS features (e.g., spectral, textural, temporal, and spatial
   features) and GBD features (e.g., spatial, temporal, semantic, and
   sequence features) were identified and analyzed in urban land use
   classification. The integration strategies for RS and GBD features were
   categorized into feature-level integration (FI) and decision-level
   integration (DI). To be more specific, the FI method integrates the RS
   and GBD features and classifies urban land use types using the
   integrated feature sets; the DI method processes RS and GBD
   independently and then merges the classification results based on
   decision rules. We also discussed other critical issues, including
   analysis unit setting, parcel segmentation, parcel labeling of land use
   types, and data integration. Our findings provide a retrospect of
   different features from RS and GBD, strategies of RS and GBD
   integration, and their pros and cons, which could help to define the
   framework for future urban land use mapping and better support urban
   planning, urban environment assessment, urban disaster monitoring and
   urban traffic analysis.},

Title = {Change Detection Based on Artificial Intelligence: State-of-the-Art and
   Challenges},

Abstract = {Change detection based on remote sensing (RS) data is an important
   method of detecting changes on the Earth's surface and has a wide range
   of applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, agriculture
   investigation, disaster assessment, and map revision. In recent years,
   integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a research
   focus in developing new change detection methods. Although some
   researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform
   traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious
   how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change
   detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods,
   applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically,
   the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first
   introduced. Then, the data from different sensors used for change
   detection, including optical RS data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   data, street view images, and combined heterogeneous data, are
   presented, and the available open datasets are also listed. The general
   frameworks of AI-based change detection methods are reviewed and
   analyzed systematically, and the unsupervised schemes used in AI-based
   change detection are further analyzed. Subsequently, the commonly used
   networks in AI for change detection are described. From a practical
   point of view, the application domains of AI-based change detection
   methods are classified based on their applicability. Finally, the major
   challenges and prospects of AI for change detection are discussed and
   delineated, including (a) heterogeneous big data processing, (b)
   unsupervised AI, and (c) the reliability of AI. This review will be
   beneficial for researchers in understanding this field.},

Title = {High-resolution urban change modeling and flood exposure estimation at a
   national scale using open geospatial data: A case study of the
   Philippines},

Abstract = {Many developing countries in Asia are experiencing rapid urban expansion
   in climate hazard prone areas. To support climate resilient urban
   planning efforts, here we present an approach for simulating future
   urban land-use changes and evaluating potential flood exposure at a high
   spatial resolution (30 m) and national scale. As a case study, we
   applied this model to the Philippines - a country frequently affected by
   extreme rainfall events. Urban land-use changes were simulated to the
   year 2050 using a trend-based logistic regression cellular automata
   model, considering three different scenarios of urban expansion
   (assuming low/medium/high population growth). Flood exposure assessment
   was then conducted by overlaying the land-use simulation results onto a
   global floodplain map. We found that approximately 6040-13,850 ha of
   urban land conversion is likely to be located in flood prone regions
   between 2019 and 2050 (depending on the scenario), affecting
   approximately 2.5-5.8 million additional urban residents. In locations
   with high rates of future urban development in flood prone areas
   (Mindanao Island, in particular), climate resilient land-use plans
   should be developed/enforced, and flood mitigation infrastructure
   protected (in the case of ``nature-based{''} infrastructure) or
   constructed. The data selected for our land-use change modeling and
   flood exposure assessment were all openly and (near-)globally available,
   with the intention that our methodology can potentially be applied in
   other countries where rapid urban expansion is occurring. The 2050 urban
   land-use maps generated in this study are available for download at
   https://www.iges.or.jp/en/pub/ph-urban2050/en to allow for their use in
   future works.},

Abstract = {Natural and manmade urban changes often have negative impacts on social,
   economic and environmental structure of the cities, such as habitat
   loss, pollution, loss of common property resources, poverty,
   displacement of communities and unemployment. Nowadays, the impacts of
   urban changes have started to be seen far beyond the borders of the
   cities. Within this context, many scholars and decision makers
   interested in urban planning have started to focus on the term of
   adaptability to cope with urban changes that create external stresses,
   dangers and risks (Yamu et al, 2015; Raco et al., 2012; Rauws et al,
   2016; Wendt, 2015; Jabareen, 2013; De Roo, 2015; Ahern, 2011). In this
   context, adaptive planning, which is defined as ``creating conditions
   for development which support a city's capacity to respond to changing
   circumstances{''}, is increasingly acknowledged in the planning
   literature (Rauws et al., 2016: 1). At national and international
   platforms, in order to cope with the current or unexpected impacts of
   urban changes such as environmental crisis linked to climate change,
   natural disasters and international migration flow due to the war,
   policies were developed in terms of adaptive planning and the adaptative
   capacity of the cities was aimed to be increased. In adaptive planning
   process different approaches are used based on the type of urban changes
   and to provide urban adaptation they focused on various key elements
   such as modelling, monitoring, simulation, learning. In this study, how
   the subject of urban adaptation was approached in Turkey was explained
   and the projects based on adaptive planning were evaluated with the aim
   of providing a first impression to this field. With this aim 48
   projects, which are determined through searching the urban adaptive
   plans in Turkey, were examined in an analytical framework. Adaptation
   subjects, related actors and their collaboration and funding programs of
   the projects were examined and their adaptive planning approaches,
   processes and key elements that they focused on were demonstrated.},

Title = {Mapping impervious surface fractions using automated Fisher transformed
   unmixing},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {232},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Spatial explicit monitoring of impervious surface fractions provides
   essential information for urban planning, urban disaster prevention and
   mitigation. Moderate spectral and spatial resolution satellite
   observation has become a tool to perform such monitoring across
   different spatial and temporal scales. Yet, one major challenge in urban
   remote sensing is the high spatial heterogeneity causing the presence of
   image pixels constituting a mixture of different land cover materials.
   Here we apply an automated unmixing procedure specifically designed to
   optimally account for the pronounced spectral variability (i.e. high
   within-class and low between-class variability) prevailing in urban
   settings. The approach is based on Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA), a
   data dimensionality reduction technique in which between-class
   variability is maximized and within-class variability is minimized while
   transforming spectra from the reflectance to the Fisher feature space.
   We integrated the FDA transformation in the widely-applied Multiple
   Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) approach in an attempt to
   more effectively address the endmember variability problem. We made use
   of online spectral libraries to train the Fisher transformation
   parameters and steer the automated selection of image endmembers. Our
   Fisher transformed MESMA algorithm (F-MESMA) was tested on medium
   spatial resolution Landsat scenes and impervious fraction maps were
   generated for five major cities located in different regions of the
   world. The output of F-MESMA was compared to the output of
   state-of-the-art spectral mixture analysis approaches which were
   specifically designed to reduce endmember variability issues. We could
   demonstrate that compared to other spectral transformation approaches,
   the ratio of within- vs between-class variability of the endmembers was
   most strongly reduced after applying the Fisher transformation. As a
   direct consequence, across all five cities F-MESMA consistently provided
   the most accurate impervious surface fraction estimates (RMSEF-MESMA =
   0.13 vs. RMSEalternative approaches = {[}0.16-0.17]).},

Abstract = {According to the United Nations Population Fund, the world's urban
   population is expected to double from 3.3 billion in 2007 to 6.4 billion
   by 2050, and it is predicted that by 2030 60\% of the world's population
   will live in cities. As cities expand, so do the food needs of urban
   populations, especially families. The urbanization process in many
   developing countries goes hand-in-hand with increasing urban poverty and
   growing food insecurity and malnutrition, especially for the urban poor.
   Changes in climate add to the challenges faced by cities and the urban
   poor. Many cities are at risk of becoming ``disaster traps{''}, either
   through the direct effects of floods, hurricanes, or rising sea levels,
   or through severe food supply problems due to droughts, hailstorms or
   frosts that affect agricultural production in their hinterlands - and
   thus the urban food markets. These are urgent and pressing challenges
   demanding an equally urgent and adequate response from city and national
   authorities as well as international support organizations. Urban
   policies, planning and design must incorporate food security
   considerations and focus on building cities that are more resilient to
   crises. Urban and periurban agriculture will have to feature prominently
   in urban food security, economic development, land use and climate
   change strategies and action plans. Several countries and local
   governments have already taken such initiatives, but in many other
   countries and cities, new initiatives are needed. This paper will
   provide a state-of-the-art overview of current national and local
   policies and experiences in integrating urban and peri-urban agriculture
   in policy making, planning and design. It will also highlight prospects
   and challenges that will require attention in future efforts to improve
   on or upscale these experiences to other cities and countries.},

Abstract = {Street closure following an earthquake makes life-saving and rescue work
   more difficult, especially in congested urban areas. After the great
   Chi-chi earthquake, recovery and reconstruction work became necessary.
   In particular, we have to investigate the street network damages and
   other effects. Considering the road improvement plan, not only
   malfunction recovery but also a comprehensive evaluation should be
   considered in future urban planning. The reliable street network against
   earthquakes is the central concern of this survey.
   This study attempts to implement a case study survey of damaged areas,
   and analyze the effecting factors on street closure. We also try to
   evaluate the road function against earthquake integrated with the
   street-damaged characteristics. Using a discriminant model of street
   closure, some design guidelines for future transportation planning
   decisions are proposed.
   Nan-tou City network has 365 links and 66.6\% of them are less than 6
   meters in width. Ton-shi Town network has 248 links and 35\% of them are
   less than 6 meters in width. The same definition of street closure
   (impassable by vehicles) of `street width less than 4 meters' was
   applied to these two case studies. This research considered several
   street network alternatives, the inaccessible nodes for all alternatives
   and analysis in order to determine a more reliable street network for
   increased safety. Results of both surveyed areas suggest that when we
   decrease the interval distance of the 8-M street, the percentage of the
   differences of inaccessible nodes will also decrease.
   The Chi-chi earthquake did great harm in the disaster area. Fortunately
   we find the street damages of our surveying area were not too severe to
   maintain their functions in times of earthquake. However, it is still
   meaningful for a transport planner to evaluate the reliability of
   residential streets because the main target of planning a residential
   street network is to restrain through-traffic in this area to ensure
   safe and comfortable conditions for pedestrians while meeting
   residential access requirements.},

Title = {Evaluating the Ability to Use Contextual Features Derived from
   Multi-Scale Satellite Imagery to Map Spatial Patterns of Urban
   Attributes and Population Distributions},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {With an increasing global population, accurate and timely population
   counts are essential for urban planning and disaster management.
   Previous research using contextual features, using mainly
   very-high-spatial-resolution imagery (<2 m spatial resolution) at
   subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with
   population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the
   statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps,
   textures, and the raw spectral signatures calculated over groups of
   pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and
   poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured
   by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally,
   previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired
   very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features
   from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and
   lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka,
   Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were
   correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These
   relationships were compared to determine what components of the
   human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial
   resolution and location impact the predictive power of these
   relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map
   urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R-2 values up to 93\%.
   Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly
   reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually
   improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution
   Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census
   units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2
   contextual features explained up to 84\% of the out-of-sample variation
   for population density.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing methods, such as LiDAR and image-based photogrammetry,
   are established approaches for capturing the physical world.
   Professional and low-cost scanning devices are capable of generating
   dense 3D point clouds. Typically, these 3D point clouds are preprocessed
   by GIS and are then used as input data in a variety of applications such
   as urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and
   simulation. The availability of area-wide 3D point clouds will
   drastically increase in the future due to the availability of novel
   capturing methods (e.g., driver assistance systems) and low-cost
   scanning devices. Applications, systems, and workflows will therefore
   face large collections of redundant, up-to-date 3D point clouds and have
   to cope with massive amounts of data. Hence, approaches are required
   that will efficiently integrate, update, manage, analyze, and visualize
   3D point clouds. In this paper, we define requirements for a system
   infrastructure that enables the integration of 3D point clouds from
   heterogeneous capturing devices and different timestamps. Change
   detection and update strategies for 3D point clouds are presented that
   reduce storage requirements and offer new insights for analysis
   purposes. We also present an approach that attributes 3D point clouds
   with semantic information (e.g., object class category information),
   which enables more effective data processing, analysis, and
   visualization. Out-of-core real-time rendering techniques then allow for
   an interactive exploration of the entire 3D point cloud and the
   corresponding analysis results. Web-based visualization services are
   utilized to make 3D point clouds available to a large community. The
   proposed concepts and techniques are designed to establish 3D point
   clouds as base datasets, as well as rendering primitives for analysis
   and visualization tasks, which allow operations to be performed directly
   on the point data. Finally, we evaluate the presented system, report on
   its applications, and discuss further research challenges. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Landslides constitute the most widespread and damaging natural hazards
   in the Constantine city. They represent a significant constraint to
   development and urban planning. In order to reduce the risk related to
   potential landslide, there is a need to develop a comprehensive
   landslide hazard map (LHM) of the area for an efficient disaster
   management and for planning development activities. The purpose of this
   research is to prepare and compare the LHMs of the Constantine city, by
   applying frequency ratio (FR), weighting factor (Wf), logistic
   regression (LR), weights of evidence (WOE), and analytical hierarchy
   process (AHP) methods used in a framework of the geographical
   information system (GIS). Firstly, a landslide inventory map has been
   prepared based on the interpretation of aerial photographs, high
   resolution satellite images, fieldwork, and available literature.
   Secondly, eight landslide-conditioning factors such as lithology, slope,
   exposure, rainfall, land use, distance to drainage, distance to road,
   and distance to fault have been considered to establish LHMs using the
   FR, Wf, LR, WOE, and AHP models in GIS. For verification, the obtained
   LHMs have been validated comparing the LHMs with the known landslide
   locations using the receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC). The
   validated results indicate that the FR method provides more accurate
   prediction (86.59 \%) of LHMs than the WOE (82.38 \%), AHP (77.86 \%),
   Wf (77.58 \%), and LR (70.45 \%) models. On the other hand, the obtained
   results showed that all the used models in this study provided a good
   accuracy in predicting landslide hazard in Constantine city. The
   established maps can be used as useful tools for risk prevention and
   land use planning in the Constantine region.},

Abstract = {A soil erosion change is one of ecological environment change studies
   important contents. The study of a soil erosion change is important.
   Shanxi Province is in the north west of China. Taiyuan basin is
   economical belt of Shanxi Province. A soil erosion change is related to
   soil erosion and vegetation cover and land use change and so on. So the
   study of a soil erosion change is important to Taiyan basin economic and
   environment. This article use colored synthesis and NDVI to carry on the
   classification of the TM remote sensing images 1990 to 2000 and use GIS
   to superimpose Taiyuan basin landing use chart, the topographic diagram
   slope chart, and the remote sensing images to study a Taiyuan basin soil
   erosion dynamical change preliminarily. The result indicated that: The
   change corrode of distributing the plain nearby the rivers is smaller;
   The first level of yellow local stations is the moderate corroded type,
   the edge run-off ditch have corroded gradually; The loess Liang shape
   rough terrain is the extremely intense corroded regions and presents the
   corroded expansion tendency; The corrode of the north-west area loess
   and the bedrock mountainous region has increase tendency.
   The soil erosion is in the world one of main harms in the world. It not
   only can cause the land to degenerate, the ecological environment
   further to be worsen, but also create the disaster. Soil erosion has
   become the most serious ecological environment question in many places
   of our country. Taiyuan area is the economical belt in loess plateau of
   our country; vegetation coverage change of the basin directly affects
   the ecological environment, the agricultural production, the urban
   planning and the development. The research on the soil erosion using the
   remote sensing technology is not only objectively and comprehensively;
   moreover it is dynamical and fast. The method obviously surpasses the
   tradition ground investigation method. This research mainly makes the
   preliminary analysis to the Taiyuan basin soil erosion change by using
   different time image remote sensing, material and so on topographic
   diagram.},

Title = {IRU-Net: An Efficient End-to-End Network for Automatic Building
   Extraction From Remote Sensing Images},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {37811-37828},
Abstract = {Automatic extraction of buildings from High-Resolution Remote Sensing
   (RS) Imagery is of great practical interest for numerous applications;
   including urban planning, change detection, disaster management,
   estimation of human population, and many other geospatial related
   applications. This paper proposes a novel efficient Improved ResU-Net
   architecture called IRU-Net, integrating spatial pyramid pooling module
   with an encoder-decoder structure, in combination with Atrous
   convolutions, modified residual connections, and a new skip connection
   between the encoder-decoder features for automatic extraction of
   buildings from RS images. Moreover, a new dual loss function called
   binary cross-entropy-dice-loss (BCEDL) is opted that make cross-entropy
   (CE) and dice loss (DL) and consider both local information and global
   information to decrease the class imbalance influence and improve the
   building extraction results. The proposed model is examined to
   demonstrate its generalization on two publicly available datasets; the
   Aerial Images for Roof Segmentation (AIRS) Dataset and the Massachusetts
   buildings dataset. The proposed IRU-Net achieved an average F-1 accuracy
   of 92.34\% for the Massachusetts dataset and 95.65\% for the AIRS
   dataset. When compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning-based
   models such as SegNet, U-Net, E-Net, ERFNet and SRI-Net, the overall
   accuracy improvements of our IRU-Net model is 9.0\% (0.9725 vs. 0.8842),
   5.2\% (0.9725 vs. 0.9218), 3.0\% (0.9725 vs. 0.9428), 1.4\% (0.9725 vs.
   0.9588) and 0.93\% (0.9725 vs. 0.9635), for AIRS dataset and 11.6\%,
   5.9\%, 3.1\%, 2.7\% and 1.4\%, for Massachusetts building dataset. These
   results prove the superiority of the proposed model for building
   extraction from high-resolution RS images.},

Title = {A comparison of scenario-based hybrid bilevel and multi-objective
   location-allocation models for earthquake emergency shelters: a case
   study in the central area of Beijing, China},

Abstract = {The accurate location and allocation of disaster emergency shelters are
   key components of effective urban planning and emergency management.
   Various models have been developed to solve the location-allocation
   problem, but gaps remain with regard to model realism and associated
   applicability. For the available location and allocation models of
   earthquake emergency shelters, uncertainty with respect to earthquake
   hazard, population exposure, rate of damage to buildings and the effects
   of evacuee behavior are often neglected or oversimplified. Moreover,
   modifying the models can be an alternative means of improving the
   solution quality when the optimization algorithm has difficulty coping
   with a complex, high-dimensional problem. This article develops a
   scenario-based hybrid bilevel model that addresses the concerns related
   to high-dimensional complexity and provides a higher degree of realism
   by incorporating the uncertainties of population dynamics and earthquake
   damage scenarios into location-allocation problems for earthquake
   emergency shelters. A modified particle swarm optimization algorithm
   combined with a simulated annealing algorithm was applied to derive
   solutions using the hybrid bilevel model and a conventional
   multi-objective model, and the solutions obtained using the two models
   were then compared. The novel features of the study include the hybrid
   bilevel model that considers the dynamic number of evacuees and its
   implementation for earthquake emergency shelter location and allocation.
   The results show that the solutions significantly differ between daytime
   and nighttime. When applied to the multi-objective model, the
   optimization algorithm is time consuming and may only find the local
   optima and provide suboptimal solutions in the considered scenarios with
   more evacuees. By contrast, the hybrid bilevel model shows more
   desirable performance because it significantly reduces the
   dimensionality of the location-allocation problem based on a
   two-step-to-reach approach. The proposed hybrid bilevel model is proven
   to be useful for optimal shelter allocation, and the presented results
   can be used as a reference for balancing the interests of the government
   and residents during the planning of shelters in Beijing.},

Abstract = {The problem of liquefaction of soil during seismic event is one of the
   important topics in the field of Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering.
   Liquefaction of soil is generally occurs in loose cohesionless saturated
   soil when pore water pressure increases suddenly due to induced ground
   motion and shear strength of soil decreases to zero and leading the
   structure situated above to undergo a large settlement, or failure. The
   failures took place due to liquefaction induced soil movement spread
   over few square km area continuously. Hence this is a problem where
   spatial variation involves and to represent this spatial variation
   Geographic Information System (GIS) is very useful in decision making
   about the area subjected to liquefaction. In this paper, GIS software
   GRAM++ is used to prepare soil liquefaction susceptibility map for
   entire Mumbai city in India by marking three zones viz, critically
   liquefiable soil, moderately liquefiable soil and non liquefiable soil.
   Extensive field borehole test data for groundwater depth, standard
   penetration test (SPT) blow counts, dry density, wet density and
   specific gravity, etc. have been collected from different parts of
   Mumbai. Simplified procedure of Youd et al. (2001) is used for
   calculation of factor of safety against soil liquefaction potential.
   Mumbai city and suburban area are formed by reclaiming lands around
   seven islands since 1865 till current date and still it is progressing
   in the area such as Navi Mumbai and beyond Borivali to Mira road
   suburban area. The factors of safety against soil liquefaction were
   determined for earthquake moment magnitude ranging from M-w = 5.0 to
   7.5. It is found that the areas like Borivali, Malad, Dahisar, Bhandup
   may prone to liquefaction for earthquake moment magnitude ranging from
   M-w = 5.0 to 7.5. The liquefaction susceptibility maps were created by
   using GRAM++ by showing the areas where the factor of safety against the
   soil liquefaction is less than one. Proposed liquefaction susceptibility
   map of Mumbai city can be used by researchers for earthquake hazard
   analysis, for the preventive measures in disaster management, for urban
   planning and further development of Mumbai city and suburban area. (C)

Abstract = {Recently, the volume of available spatial data increased tremendously.
   For instance, in November 2013 NASA announced the release of hundreds of
   Terabytes of its earth remote sensing dataset. Such data includes but
   not limited to: weather maps, socioeconomic data, vegetation indices,
   geological maps, and more. Making sense of such spatial data will be
   beneficial for several applications that may transform science and
   society - For example: (1) Space Science: that allows astronomers to
   study and probably discover new features of both the earth and the outer
   space, (2) Socio-Economic Analysis: that includes for example climate
   change analysis, study of deforestation, population migration, and
   variation in sea levels, (3) Urban Planning: assisting government in
   city planning, road network design, and transportation engineering, (4)
   Disaster Planning: that helps in assessing the impact of natural
   disasters. The main aim of this paper is to investigate novel data
   management techniques that enable interactive and scalable exploration
   of big spatial data.
   The paper envisions novel system architectures that provide support for
   interactive and spatial data exploration, as follows: (1) The paper
   suggests extending data analytics frameworks, e.g., Apache Spark, to
   support spatial data types and operations at scale. The resulting
   framework will serve as a scalable backbone for processing spatial data
   exploration tasks. (2) It also sketches novel structures and algorithms
   that leverage modern hardware, e.g., SSDs, and in-memory data processing
   techniques to efficiently store and access spatial data. Second, the
   paper proposes extending spatial database systems to support an
   exploration-aware spatial query evaluation paradigm through three novel
   components: (1) Spatial Query Steering: that allows the user to slightly
   modify the query conditions online (zooming in/out) and retrieve the new
   results in very low latency. (2) Recommendation-Aware Spatial Querying:
   that injects the recommendation functionality inside classical spatial
   query executors to support spatial data recommendation. It leverages
   recommendation algorithms to predict what spatial objects/areas the user
   would like based on her past interactions with the system. (3) Spatial
   Query Approximation: That aims at achieving interactive performance by
   studying the tradeoff between approximate spatial data exploration and
   query response time.},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional building models are important for various
   applications, such as disaster management and urban planning. The
   development of laser scanning sensor technologies has resulted in many
   different approaches for efficient building model generation using LiDAR
   data. Despite this effort, generation of these models lacks economical
   and reliable techniques that fully exploit the advantage of LiDAR data.
   Therefore, this research aims to develop a framework for fully-automated
   building model generation by integrating data-driven and model-driven
   methods using LiDAR datasets.
   The building model generation starts by employing LiDAR data for
   building detection and approximate boundary determination. The generated
   building boundaries are then integrated into a model-based processing
   strategy because LiDAR derived planes show irregular boundaries due to
   the nature of LiDAR point acquisition. The focus of the research is
   generating models for the buildings with right-angled-corners, which can
   be described with a collection of rectangles under the assumption that
   the majority of the buildings in urban areas belong to this category.
   Therefore, by applying the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) algorithm
   recursively, the LiDAR boundaries are decomposed into sets of rectangles
   for further processing. At the same time, the quality of the MBRs is
   examined to verify that the buildings, from which the boundaries are
   generated, are buildings with right-angled-corners. The parameters that
   define the model primitives are adjusted through a model-based boundary
   fitting procedure using LiDAR boundaries. The level of details in the
   final Digital Building Model is based on the number of recursions during
   the MBR processing, which in turn are determined by the LiDAR point
   density. The model-based boundary fitting improves the quality of the
   generated boundaries and as seen in experimental results, the quality
   depends on the average LiDAR point spacing. This research thus develops
   an approach which not only automates the building model generation, but
   also achieves the best accuracy of the model while utilizing only LiDAR
   data. (C) 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote

Abstract = {Urban models are computer-based solutions used for testing theories
   about spatial location and interaction between land uses and related
   activities. They also provide digital environments for testing the
   consequences of physical planning policies on the future form of cities.
   Earlier, 3D city models were prepared using stereo aerial photography,
   topographic data and conventional surveying. The geospatial information
   was extracted using either visual or digital classification techniques.
   Presently the 3D city models is prepared with the help of ALTM data
   along with very high resolution imagery, which is costly and time
   consuming. As alternatives, Cartosat-1 stereo data of the order of 2.5 m
   resolution, it becomes more practical and economical to generate digital
   surface model (DSM) with an accuracy of 4 m. Cartosat-II data with 1 m
   resolution fused with LISS-IV data give high resolution images for
   building footprint extraction. The availability of high resolution
   Cartosat-I stereo satellite data assists urban planners and municipal
   authorities to create a model and visualize the urban space in three
   dimensions. 3D visualization models have a variety of applications in
   urban studies. The studies includes urban morphological mapping,
   disaster management, updation, virtual reality and generation of fly
   through etc. The primary interest of the planners is not limited towards
   the extraction of urban features from satellite data. Planners also have
   interest in creation of 3D models of buildings and terrain surface for
   detailed urban planning. Therefore, to develop 3D city models 2.5 m
   Cartosat-1 stereo data fused with 1 m merged product of Cartosat-II and
   LISS-IV to create DSM and building footprints respectively. Keeping the
   significance of use of stereo satellite data, an attempt has been made
   to generate a 3D building model for Ahmedabad and Hyderabad cities. The
   3D building model generated by employing geoinformatics techniques with
   Level of Details (LOD-1). The primary aim of this study was to develop
   geoinformatics techniques for the extraction of urban features based on
   object oriented classification techniques with level of details 1
   (LOD-1) using photogrammetric DEM. This paper discusses all these
   techniques and their usefulness in 3D city modeling exercises.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal evolution and surface response of land subsidence over a
   large-scale land creation area on the Chinese Loess Plateau},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {For Yan'an (China) and many other cities on the Loess Plateau,
   development is limited by a severe lack of available land. To support
   the city's sustainable development, the Yan'an New District (YND) was
   constructed in 2012 through a mountain excavation and city construction
   (MECC) project. However, rapid land creation and urbanization have
   caused extensive anthropogenic land subsidence, which may impose new
   constraints on YND development. This study investigated the
   spatiotemporal development pattern and long-term temporal response of
   land subsidence related to land creation in the YND. First, 95
   Sentinel-1 images acquired from 2016 to 2019 were analyzed with the
   small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar
   (InSAR) method to reveal the long-term displacement rates and
   spatiotemporal displacement patterns in the YND region. The
   interrelationship between the spatiotemporal variations in ground
   subsidence and the land creation history was also discussed. Then, an
   exponential model was employed to characterize the InSAR time series to
   assess the long-term displacement trends and temporal response of the
   land-subsidence process related to land creation. The results suggest
   that the observed long-term subsidence patterns in the land creation
   area showed an exponentially decaying trend with the fill compaction
   process. The newer and thicker the loess fill foundation was, the
   greater the subsidence rate and the smaller the decay trend over the
   same observation time, indicating slower stabilization relative to the
   compaction of the filling loess. The spatial variation in the
   significant land subsidence zone gradually shifted toward the newly
   formed fill area as the land creation area expanded. In addition, the
   ground displacement response estimates highlighted that most of the
   Qiaoergou subsidence zone in the YND will continue to sink for
   approximately 7.2 years following the InSAR observations used here.
   These findings have important implications for disaster mitigation and
   urban planning in similar large-scale land creation areas.},

Title = {Attitudes of people toward climate change regarding the bioclimatic
   comfort level in tourism cities; evidence from Antalya, Turkey},

Abstract = {In addition to several negative environmental effects, climate change,
   which reduces bioclimatic comfort levels especially in urban areas, also
   has economic implications, especially in cities where the economic
   structure is tourism-oriented. Considering most of the tourism practices
   are based on outdoor activities in cities such as Antalya, it is of
   great importance to determine bioclimatic comfort level as well as the
   attitudes of people toward climate change who live in those conditions
   to be able to take proper precautions in terms of tourism and urban
   planning. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to reveal the
   bioclimatic comfort conditions of Antalya city center, and a
   comprehensive questionnaire was conducted with the people living in the
   area questioning the opinions on reasons and consequences of climate
   change, perceivable effects of climate change in Antalya, and
   suggestions to prevent or reduce the adverse effects. The areas with
   appropriate bioclimatic comfort conditions were determined and mapped
   via geographical information systems using temperature and relative
   humidity data of the years between 1960 and 2018. The data gathered via
   questionnaires were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis,
   regression, correlation, and structural equation modelling via SPSS and
   AMOS software. According to the results, it was determined that in some
   parts of city center the bioclimatic comfort conditions decreased to
   levels that could reach harmful dimensions for human health and the
   analysis of the questionnaires revealed that people living in that area
   state that the effects of climate change are perceivable as the
   precipitation seasons have become irregular. According to the
   participants, it was determined that a 1-unit increase in environmental
   measures causes a decrease of 0.136 units in disasters (R-2 = 1.1\%). In
   comparison, 1-unit increase of Administrative Precautions will cause
   0.030 units decrease in effects of climate change on vital needs (R-2 =
   1.4\%). These analysis results show that the respondents expect the
   disaster scenarios to decrease when environmental measures are
   increased.},

Abstract = {The damage distribution in the town of Adra (south-eastern Spain) during
   the 1993 and 1994 Adra earthquakes of magnitude Mw similar to 5.0 and
   maximum intensity degree of VII (European Macroseismic Scale) was mainly
   concentrated in the southeast sector, where the low-diagenetic (soft)
   sediments outcrop. As new urbanizations are being planned in this
   sector, a soil classification based on the shallow shear-wave velocity
   (V-s) structure is needed. For the purpose of earthquake disaster
   mitigation, the Spatial Autocorrelation (SPAC) and the Multichannel
   Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) methods were used to propose integrated
   2D V-s models for the seismic response characterization of the shallow
   geology. Joint inversion of H/V spectral ratios of ambient noise,
   interpreted under the Diffuse Field Approach and the dispersion curves
   derived from the SPAC method allowed us to obtain more constrained
   models. Both SPAC and MASW methods provided similar results for the
   surveyed geological formations. From these models, a classification of
   the geological formations was carried out in terms of V-s30 values and
   Eurocode 8 (European Committee for Standardization 1998) classes. Lower
   V-s30 values in the 180-360 m/s range were found in the southeastern
   sector of the town, where soft sediments outcrop and some building
   damage was reported during the 1993-1994 earthquakes. The highest V-s30
   values exceeding 800 m/s appear in the northern sector, where the
   hardest rocks outcrop and no building damage was reported. The
   combination of the well-suited Vs database prepared for different
   geological formations with the 1:5,000 scale geological mapping was an
   important step to obtain the detailed soil microzonation map of Adra.
   This approach offered a new predictive insight into the building damage
   distribution, which would contribute to the appropriate urban planning
   for the future growth of the town.},

Abstract = {Cities are complex and dynamic systems that reproduce the interactions
   between socio-economic and environmental processes at a local and global
   scale. This complexity constitutes a significant challenge for urban
   planning. One effective source of information about the urban
   environment is remote sensing data. Sealed surfaces generate intense
   rainwater run-off which the drainage network cannot accommodate, thus
   promoting flooding events. Mapping urban flood risk implies knowing the
   spatial distribution and extent of the pervious and impervious areas in
   the city. These are important variables for planning, mitigation,
   preparedness and response to potential events. Green areas are an
   important land use in urban areas, performing relevant environment
   functions, such as improving urban climate, reducing atmospheric
   pollution, providing amenities, aesthetical benefits and a good
   environment for urban populations. However, the urbanization process
   generally occurs at the expense of agricultural or forested areas, thus
   contributing to degrade the urban environment quality. The present case
   study addresses the quantification of impervious land at the city scale
   through remote sensing data. A methodology for generating a large-scale
   Land Cover Map for the city of Lisbon, Portugal is proposed. The data
   source is Very-High Resolution (VHR) IKONOS pansharp image, from 2008,
   with a spatial resolution of 1 m, and a normalized Digital Surface Model
   (nDSM) from 2006. The methodology was based on the object-based
   extraction of features of interest, namely: vegetation, soil and
   impervious surfaces. After deriving the land cover information from
   remote sensing data, several applications can be implemented. Indicators
   on land sealing area, quantification of green area, or the available
   vacant soil in the city, are ecological measures that can be used as
   tools for cities to assess and communicate different environmental
   risks, and promote strategies and measures of sustainable urban
   development and disaster risk management. It is demonstrated that using
   a methodology based on large-scale geographic information, quick
   updating of detailed land cover information is possible and can be used
   to support decisions in a crisis situation where official maps are
   generally outdated, or to evaluate the quality of the urban environment.},

Abstract = {The 1902-1905 activity of Montagne Pelee represents a moderately large
   eruptive cycle typical of a subduction zone volcano. It followed a
   three-centuries-long repose interrupted only in 1792 by two small
   phreatic explosions and minor (phreatomagmatic?) eruptions in 1851-1852.
   The volcano decidedly awakened in early 1902 with increasing fumaroles
   at l'Etang Sec summit crater, light earthquakes and phreatic activity
   from 23 April onwards. On 2-3 May the eruption became phreatomagmatic
   and much more active. Destructive lahars culminated on 5 May and during
   the night of 7-8 May, causing 23 casualties at the Guerin factory and
   about 400 others at Le Precheur. On 8 May at 08:02 local time a
   climactic `nuee ardente' destroyed the city of Saint-Pierre, 8 km south
   of the crater, and killed all its 27-28,000 inhabitants but one, or
   possibly two. Testimonies from eyewitnesses of this event, calculations
   made on its effects, and careful studies of its deposits support the
   interpretation of a powerful lateral blast (175-140 m/s) accompanied by
   a fast-moving pyroclastic flow which was directed N-S, i.e. toward the
   town itself. The temperature of the flow decreased from that of the acid
   andesite magma (about 900-degrees-C) at the crater to 400-200-degrees-C
   as it reached Saint-Pierre. Climactic `pelean' eruptions, initiated by
   strong explosions, were renewed on 20 May and 30 August. This latter
   produced 1,000 additional victims at Morne Rouge, making a total of
   about 29,000 victims for the entire eruptive period. Less violent
   eruptions, without major explosions, took place on 26 May, 6 June, 9
   July and from late 1902 to July 1905, generating slow-moving pyroclastic
   flows (50 m/s or less), linked to relatively quiet dome growth.
   The catastrophe of Saint-Pierre resulted from an insufficient knowledge
   of volcanic hazards at the time and particularly from the total
   ignorance of pyroclastic flow (nuee ardente) phenomena. Future hazards
   in Martinique include the renewal of pelean eruptions and widespread
   plinian activity, such as has occurred in the past 5,000 years, together
   with a less probable sector collapse triggering tsunami. As major
   magmatic eruptions of Montagne Pelee may be separated by repose periods
   of more than 500 years, a long-term instrumental surveillance of the
   volcano is needed, and adequate concepts in urban planning should be
   developed and sustained in the next centuries.},

Title = {Inclusive approaches to urban climate adaptation planning and

Abstract = {As cities increasingly engage in climate adaptation planning, many are
   seeking to promote public participation and facilitate the engagement of
   different civil society actors. Still, the variations that exist among
   participatory approaches and the merits and tradeoffs associated with
   each are not well understood. This article examines the experiences of
   Quito (Ecuador) and Surat (India) to assess how civil society actors
   contribute to adaptation planning and implementation. The results
   showcase two distinct approaches to public engagement. The first
   emphasizes participation of experts, affected communities, and a wide
   array of citizens to sustain broadly inclusive programmes that
   incorporate local needs and concerns into adaptation processes and
   outcomes. The second approach focuses on building targeted partnerships
   between key government, private, and civil society actors to
   institutionalize robust decision-making structures, enhance abilities to
   raise funds, and increase means to directly engage with local community
   and international actors. A critical analysis of these approaches
   suggests more inclusive planning processes correspond to higher climate
   equity and justice outcomes in the short term, but the results also
   indicate that an emphasis on building dedicated multi-sector governance
   institutions may enhance long-term programme stability, while ensuring
   that diverse civil society actors have an ongoing voice in climate
   adaptation planning and implementation.
   Policy relevance
   Many local governments in the Global South experience severe capacity
   and resource constraints. Cities are often required to devolve
   large-scale planning and decision-making responsibilities, such as those
   critical to climate adaptation, to different civil society actors. As a
   result, there needs to be more rigorous assessments of how civil society
   participation contributes to the adaptation policy and planning process
   and what local social, political, and economic factors dictate the way
   cities select different approaches to public engagement. Also, since
   social equity and justice are key indicators for determining the
   effectiveness and sustainability of adaptation interventions, urban
   adaptation plans and policies must also be designed according to local
   institutional strengths and civic capacities in order to account for the
   needs of the poor and most vulnerable. Inclusivity, therefore, is
   critical for ensuring equitable planning processes and just adaptation
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Urban land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition
   of various land use types are critically important for urban planning,
   environmental management, disaster control, health protection, and
   biodiversity conservation. Recent advances in remote sensing and social
   sensing data and methods have shown great potentials in mapping urban
   land use categories, but they are still constrained by mixed land uses,
   limited predictors, non-localized models, and often relatively low
   accuracies. To inform these issues, we proposed a robust and
   cost-effective framework for mapping urban land use categories using
   openly available multi-source geo-spatial ``big data{''}. With street
   blocks generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the minimum
   classification unit, we integrated an expansive set of multi-scale
   spatially explicit information on land surface, vertical height,
   socio-economic attributes, social media, demography, and topography. We
   further proposed to apply the automatic ensemble learning that leverages
   a bunch of machine learning algorithms in deriving optimal urban land
   use classification maps. Results of block-level urban land use
   classification in five metropolitan areas of the United States found the
   overall accuracies of major-class (Level-I) and minor-class (Level-II)
   classification could be high as 91\% and 86\%, respectively. A
   multi-model comparison revealed that for urban land use classification
   with high-dimensional features, the multi-layer stacking ensemble models
   achieved better performance than base models such as random forest,
   extremely randomized trees, LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks. We
   found without very-high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program
   imagery, the classification results derived from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2,
   and other open big data based features could achieve plausible overall
   accuracies of Level-I and Level-II classification at 88\% and 81\%,
   respectively. We also found that model transferability depended highly
   on the heterogeneity in characteristics of different regions. The
   methods and findings in this study systematically elucidate the role of
   data sources, classification methods, and feature transferability in
   block-level land use classifications, which have important implications
   for mapping multi-scale essential urban land use categories.},

Abstract = {This research analyses and describes in detail how the digital biennale
   activities that are a part of the Indonesian Digital arts community has
   become a form of criticism and silent resistance to the social hegemony.
   It refers to the ideology, norms, rules, and myths that exist in modern
   society in Indonesia, especially the reproduction of hoax content. Hoax
   refers to the logic people who live in a world of cyber media with all
   of its social implications. This phenomenon is a problem, and it is at
   the heart of the exploration of the art community in East Java Biennale.
   The critical social theory perspective of Gramsci's theory forms the
   basis of this research analysis. The qualitative research approach used
   a digital ethnomethodology research method focused on the online and
   offline social movements in the Biennale Art Community. The data
   collection techniques used were observation and non-active participation
   in the process of reproduction-related to the exhibition of Indonesian
   Biennale digital artworks. It was then analyzed using Gramsci's hegemony
   theory. The purpose of this study was to describe the process of social
   movements in a digital format conducted by the Indonesian Biennale when
   reproducing works of art to counteract the dominance and hegemony of the
   Hoax phenomenon in Indonesia. The benefit of this research was that it
   obtained a preposition of Gramsci's hegemony theory in the world of
   digital art as created by contemporary Indonesian Biennale artists.
   Digital technology has had a tremendous effect on the media industry,
   government, trade, informal industry sector, human resources, urban
   planning, services, disaster relief, health, education, religion,
   artistic and cultural expression, in addition to various other fields.
   The conclusion obtained from this research is that there is a formation
   of a new hegemony, a digital hegemony. This new hegemony is of
   particular concern for the digital artists in East Java Biennale.
   Through the digital format works, the artists also try to communicate
   their art as a form of silent resistance, protest, and criticism of the
   hegemony that occurs in society, referring to the ideology, norms, and
   myths. It can be called a digital counter-hegemony.},

Title = {Multi-Object Segmentation in Complex Urban Scenes from High-Resolution
   Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Terrestrial features extraction, such as roads and buildings from aerial
   images using an automatic system, has many usages in an extensive range
   of fields, including disaster management, change detection, land cover
   assessment, and urban planning. This task is commonly tough because of
   complex scenes, such as urban scenes, where buildings and road objects
   are surrounded by shadows, vehicles, trees, etc., which appear in
   heterogeneous forms with lower inter-class and higher intra-class
   contrasts. Moreover, such extraction is time-consuming and expensive to
   perform by human specialists manually. Deep convolutional models have
   displayed considerable performance for feature segmentation from remote
   sensing data in the recent years. However, for the large and continuous
   area of obstructions, most of these techniques still cannot detect road
   and building well. Hence, this work's principal goal is to introduce two
   novel deep convolutional models based on UNet family for multi-object
   segmentation, such as roads and buildings from aerial imagery. We
   focused on buildings and road networks because these objects constitute
   a huge part of the urban areas. The presented models are called
   multi-level context gating UNet (MCG-UNet) and bi-directional ConvLSTM
   UNet model (BCL-UNet). The proposed methods have the same advantages as
   the UNet model, the mechanism of densely connected convolutions,
   bi-directional ConvLSTM, and squeeze and excitation module to produce
   the segmentation maps with a high resolution and maintain the boundary
   information even under complicated backgrounds. Additionally, we
   implemented a basic efficient loss function called boundary-aware loss
   (BAL) that allowed a network to concentrate on hard semantic
   segmentation regions, such as overlapping areas, small objects,
   sophisticated objects, and boundaries of objects, and produce
   high-quality segmentation maps. The presented networks were tested on
   the Massachusetts building and road datasets. The MCG-UNet improved the
   average F1 accuracy by 1.85\%, and 1.19\% and 6.67\% and 5.11\% compared
   with UNet and BCL-UNet for road and building extraction, respectively.
   Additionally, the presented MCG-UNet and BCL-UNet networks were compared
   with other state-of-the-art deep learning-based networks, and the
   results proved the superiority of the networks in multi-object
   segmentation tasks.},

Abstract = {Experience with both analog and digital systems show that laboratory
   calibration is not necessarily valid in airborne conditions; whereas the
   advantages of field calibration are that the entire imaging system is
   calibrated and not alone the optical part; and the parameters determined
   are valid in operational airborne conditions (Cramer 2004, 2006;
   Honkavaara et al. International Archives of Photogrammetry{''}, Remote
   Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 36, 2008a, b). The result of
   calibration and testing is dependent on a number of permanent system
   factors and systematic and random components associated with camera,
   imaging system, flight, atmosphere, object and data post-processing
   (Honkavaara et al. International Archives of Photogrammetry{''}, Remote
   Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 36, 2008a, b) those affect the
   quality of the raw images produced by the sensors. It is therefore
   important to calibrate the aerial or satellite imaging sensors in
   specially designed fields so that the performance of the entire chain is
   assessed taking into consideration all the influencing factors. In
   addition to imaging sensors, ISO 19159 for `Calibration and validation
   of remote sensing imagery sensors and data' also incorporates airborne
   laser scanners, imaging radar and water borne sonar systems (Kresse
   2010). The task of developing uniform practices and standards for field
   calibration and testing has been taken up by several international
   working groups but hardly any permanent multipurpose test field like the
   one in Sjokulla, Finland with facilities for radiometric and spatial
   resolution calibration and networks of targeted benchmarks for geometric
   calibration at large, medium and small imaging scales is available.
   National Remote Sensing Centre's (NRSC) interest is in sensor's
   performance to solve the question of whether the technology will be able
   to fulfill present standards of map compilation for disaster management
   support, urban planning \& development, cadastral resurvey, utility
   mapping, corridor mapping for canal, road, rail alignment, etc. those
   need very accurate data for its effective usage. With this objective a
   multi-sensor calibration field, first of its kind in India, designed
   with targets for geometric calibration, radiometric calibration, spatial
   resolution and height accuracy calibration is under construction in
   Shadnagar about 50 km away from Hyderabad that would serve aerial
   sensors and very high resolution satellite sensors better than 1 m.},

Title = {CityGML - Interoperable semantic 3D city models},
Journal = {ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {12-33},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {CityGML is the international standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium
   (OGC) for the representation and exchange of 3D city models. It defines
   the three-dimensional geometry, topology, semantics and appearance of
   the most relevant topographic objects in urban or regional contexts.
   These definitions are provided in different, well-defined
   Levels-of-Detail (multiresolution model). The focus of CityGML is on the
   semantical aspects of 3D city models, its structures, taxonomies and
   aggregations, allowing users to employ virtual 3D city models for
   advanced analysis and visualization tasks in a variety of application
   domains such as urban planning, indoor/outdoor pedestrian navigation,
   environmental simulations, cultural heritage, or facility management.
   This is in contrast to purely geometrical/graphical models such as KML,
   VRML, or X3D, which do not provide sufficient semantics. CityGML is
   based on the Geography Markup Language (GML), which provides a
   standardized geometry model. Due to this model and its well-defined
   semantics and structures, CityGML facilitates interoperable data
   exchange in the context of geo web services and spatial data
   infrastructures. Since its standardization in 2008, CityGML has become
   used on a worldwide scale: tools from notable companies in the
   geospatial field provide CityGML interfaces. Many applications and
   projects use this standard. CityGML is also having a strong impact on
   science: numerous approaches use CityGML, particularly its semantics,
   for disaster management, emergency responses, or energy-related
   applications as well as for visualizations, or they contribute to
   CityGML, improving its consistency and validity, or use CityGML,
   particularly its different Levels-of-Detail, as a source or target for
   generalizations.
   This paper gives an overview of CityGML, its underlying concepts, its
   Levels-of-Detail, how to extend it, its applications, its likely future
   development, and the role it plays in scientific research. Furthermore,
   its relationship to other standards from the fields of computer graphics
   and computer-aided architectural design and to the prospective INSPIRE
   model are discussed, as well as the impact CityGML has and is having on
   the software industry, on applications of 3D city models, and on science
   generally. (C) 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote

Abstract = {This paper discusses the need for geospatial information technologies in
   developing countries to support sustainable development. One of the
   major issues facing many developing countries is the need for better
   utilization and protection of their natural resources. In the world's
   industrialized nations remote sensing and GIS technologies are used in
   many applications that include, but not limited to, natural resources
   management and protection, environmental monitoring, agriculture,
   geology, hydrology and water resource management, disaster management,
   urban planning, monitoring spread of infectious diseases, and marine
   studies. These nations have made heavy investment in building and
   deploying space assets to monitor earth resources. However, very little
   has been done to promote the leveraging of this investment in technology
   by developing countries. There are far reaching benefits to these
   emerging economies through the exploitation of this technology. Not only
   could they be forewarned about natural disasters to minimize loss of
   life and property, but, they could use it to enhance their country's
   critical food supply and water resources and even develop an effective
   natural resource exploitation (e.g. oil and gas) capability. These
   capabilities will allow developing countries to become more self-reliant
   and less dependent on other countries and international aid agencies.
   Remote sensing and GIS technologies can be transferred to developing
   countries for implementation of large-scale and national GIS systems.
   Such systems will integrate advanced computing platforms, high-speed
   networks, high performance image processing and GIS products,
   sophisticated data capturing devices, state-of-the-art product
   generation equipment, and robust archival and dissemination elements. A
   variety of remotely sensed data (multi-temporal, spatial, and spectral
   resolution), geospatial, and in-situ data will be integrated to generate
   value-added products, extract thematic/spatial features, and derive
   information to support operational governmental applications and
   decision-making
   When fully implemented, a national GIs system will revolutionize public
   and private sector practices through modernization of records and
   computerization of services. This technological revolution will
   significantly contribute to the continual economic and technological
   advancement. Through such a system, government officials will be
   provided with reliable, accurate, current data and automated tools to
   make informed decisions, formulate sound polices, and implement sensible
   short-term and long-term plans to properly allocate and manage
   resources. As a result, citizens of developing countries will realize
   higher standards of living and a wide-range of socioeconomic benefits.},

Abstract = {In order to declare new lands for urbanization in the Valle del Cauca
   Department at the west of Colombia, a study was carried on for several
   municipalities. The study began assembling previous natural disasters
   historical information originated by floods; by visiting the territory
   and meeting with local representatives, leaders and social
   organizations. Topographic and landscape features for the flood plains
   and sloping lands were measured; also, the bathymetry was done in
   rivers, creeks and channels; as well river's bed material
   characteristics. Land-use changes and dynamics and soil physical,
   geotechnical characteristics, infiltration capacity and hydraulic
   conductivity, were evaluated too. For each watershed, the meteorological
   and hydrological characteristics were studied and its variation in time
   and space. Hydrological and hydraulics mathematical models were used in
   order to evaluate rivers and watershed responses to several scenarios
   with regard to changes in land use and climate change. Applying some
   methodologies according to the intensity and frequency of floods, risk's
   maps were obtained for each town and surrounding area; each map included
   four flood risk levels: none, low, medium and high. Flooded area maps,
   allows determining the affected housing projects, industries, social
   facilities and infrastructure of the neighborhood, for different events'
   occurrence probability. It was conducted a survey to the families that
   live within the flooding occurrence risk area, in order to know their
   composition, activities, occupation, education level and housing
   construction quality. Analyzing the effects of each event, to the
   population and infrastructure, the vulnerability maps were obtained for
   each community. According to the simulation process results, those
   obtained flooded areas; match with those previous reported flooded
   areas, giving a good confidence degree, to establish prevention and
   mitigation politics. The study establishes different flooded areas that
   affected already inhabited lands, infrastructure, industries and other
   uses; giving the opportunity to relocate construction projects or to
   define mitigation programs, also after the study ` s results were
   recommended the suitable areas for the development of new housing
   programs, industries, recreation facility's location or for
   environmental services. By the other hand, emerge as a need to organize
   education campaigns, to increase public awareness of the community
   members, industries and society, around the disaster prevention programs
   a cause flood and for other natural origin disasters.},

Title = {Zbor imaat graganite: The First Sociological Study, the Polish
   Sociological Expert Aid to Macedonia in the Mid-1960s and the
   Post-Earthquake History of Interethnic Relations in Skopje},
Journal = {COLLOQUIA HUMANISTICA},

Abstract = {On the early morning of 26 July 1963, a calamitous earthquake struck the
   Macedonian capital of Skopje, taking the lives of 1,070 people and
   destroying more than two-thirds of the urban fabric. The politically
   non-aligned Yugoslav government immediately issued a call for help for
   the earthquake-torn city, which was picked up by more than eighty states
   across the globe, as well as the United Nations and other international
   organizations. The domestic authorities, in turn, sought to reimagine
   post-disaster Skopje as a ``City of Solidarity,{''} a symbol of the
   trans-bloc cooperation, and an ``Open City{''} - one open to domestic
   and intrafederal migrations and the epitome of the trans-Yugoslav
   state-building slogan of ``brotherhood and unity.{''} However, the
   mounting interethnic tensions in the 1980s, the Yugoslav dissolution,
   and the 2001 insurgency dramatically shifted the public optics over the
   post-earthquake urban reconstruction and demographic politics - a
   narrative which found a particular stronghold in the memory politics of
   post-2001 Macedonia.
   The present paper discusses one overlooked episode from the
   post-earthquake reconstruction of Skopje: from December 1964 to April
   1965, the first ever large-scale sociological survey was conducted among
   Skopjans as part of the Polish expert aid and the preparations for the
   UN-sponsored Skopje Urban Project. Although the published study
   contained an exclusive portrayal of the economic and demographic
   features of the local households and revealed some of the major
   interethnic issues in the city, it never received proper treatment by
   the authorities and - up to the Yugoslav dissolution - in the
   scholarship. Thus, in order to present the major outcomes of this
   cross-national endeavor, I reconstruct the prehistory, the fieldwork and
   the immediate results of the survey by triangulating a set of archival
   materials, semi-structured interviews with its Polish and Macedonian
   conveners, and secondary literature on Skopje's urban reconstruction.
   Finally, I argue that the survey - its realization, results and
   aftermath - can be read as a key to a better understanding of the
   post-earthquake history of Skopje and the interethnic relations in the
   city.},

Abstract = {The world is facing the observable and direct impacts of climate change
   in the shape of extreme weather events, irregular precipitation, glacial
   melt, sea-level rise, an asymmetric average temperature trends, higher
   oceanic temperatures, damage to natural ecosystems, and biodiversity. In
   2015, collective wisdom stirred the global community to agree upon two
   unprecedented milestones in recent human history-the Paris agreement and
   sustainable development goals (SDGs). The twin global agreements set a
   platform for collective efforts to secure socio-economic and climatic
   sustainability. Pakistan also joined the board to put forth policy
   interventions for the mitigation and adaption of climate change risks to
   maintain symmetry between the environmental quality and economic
   development. The government of Pakistan (GOP) formulated the National
   Climate Change Policy (NCCP (2012)) and passed the Pakistan Climate
   Change Act (PCCA (2017)) to provide an impetus for the implementation of
   the NCCP. Yet, an appropriate assessment and prioritization of the
   objectives of the NCCP are indispensable for productive and effective
   policies to achieve the targets. This study serves this purpose by
   prioritizing the climate change policy objectives (CCPOs) based on
   symmetric principles, i.e., energy, transport, urban and town planning,
   industry, and agriculture as criteria, with 17 sub-criteria in total.
   The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) results show that the
   energy sector is the most pivotal while implementing the NCCP. Energy
   production is the most critical area that needs mitigation policy
   intervention for shifting the energy mix of the economy from high-carbon
   to low-carbon energy. The fuzzy AHP analysis further revealed the
   railway, population and urbanization, air pollution, crop growing
   practices and techniques as the most important related to transport,
   urban planning, industry, and agriculture sub-criteria, respectively.
   The fuzzy VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR)
   analysis showed the ranking of the CCPOs from high to low through the
   integration of policies, institutional capacity building, water
   security, natural resource management, natural disaster management,
   environmental financial structure development, and social sector
   development. The findings of the present research would be helpful for
   experts and policymakers to re-examine the NCCP and put forth action
   plans to achieve sustainable climate and SDGs.},

Abstract = {In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural
   phenomena, there is a pressing need for an efficient environment logging
   that provides structural information to administrators for a better
   management and urban planning. This paper proposes a novel utility model
   for structural health monitoring that would enable early detection of
   risk factors and mitigation of loss. The proposed utility computing
   model takes the input data in terms of `number of occupants' in a
   building (i.e. MAC, International Mobile Equipment Identifier addresses
   and biometric attendance system installed) and SHM system data (i.e.
   sensors readings). It give visual representation of all the data for
   utility managers and experts to decide better location of SHM and number
   of SHM needed per zone depending on high disturbances created due to
   higher occupancy and number of structures per zone. Denser area with
   higher structures and higher population will require more precise and
   accurate SHM systems compared to rural areas. It also analyzes the data
   from SHM system and using simple machine learning algorithm give
   experts' suggestions for type of SHM needed at an area. It make it
   possible for the data of each and every device of SHM systems over
   several zones to be accessible by specific authorities that can be used
   to predict as well as forecast any natural disaster. The Structural
   Health Monitoring utility model is unique in terms of its heterogeneity
   of resource management in realizing the utility processes. Finally, a
   case study of Qatar University is looked at where nodes are distributed
   in zones along with occupant measuring is used over each building. The
   data was taken over simulated occupation models and mathematical models
   from literature for occupation and zone calculation using ideal SHM
   system data. It can be inferred from the data that real-time analysis
   data will act similar to simulated and proposed Utility Computing System
   will give visual data and analyze the zones as can be seen in the
   results. Therefore, SHM Utility Computing model is efficient and most
   effective system that save cost as well as prepare authorities for
   maintenance of a structure or crisis management due to external
   surroundings.},

Abstract = {The cost of generating electricity from wind is becoming competitive
   vis-a-vis new-build fuel driven plants, especially with respect to
   constant increase of prices of oil and gas, but also with respect to the
   new barriers and resistance against nuclear generation (especially after
   Fukushima nuclear plant disaster). On the other hand, wind energy as an
   alternative to thermal power plants is a clean source of energy that
   produces no greenhouse gas emissions, wastewaters and solid waste, and
   last but not least, there is no fuel requirement for WindPark. The
   percentage of participation of RES in the total consumption of final
   energy by 2020 in Macedonia should be equal to 21\%. Following the
   principle of the promotion of sustainable regional and environmental
   development as direct implementation of EU policies, the aim of the
   study presented in this paper is to deliver a framework for spatial
   planning and sustainable development by detecting the potential areas
   for investment in wind energy sources. The study presented in this paper
   promotes eight potential locations for building of wind parks, presents
   the requirements and procedures to local and international investors,
   and facilitates the building of wind parks in a very short time. The
   evaluation of the impact analyses that wind parks may have on the
   environment and to offer possible mitigation techniques, this study
   presents the results of the detailed analysis for selection of potential
   locations for building of wind parks by mapping of: potential number of
   wind generators on selected wind parks sites; locations of neighbouring
   objects which might cause interaction and the effect of cumulative
   influence; the impact of sound emission (in terms of loudness) to local
   population; energy connection to existing or new energy infrastructure
   (layout of lines, location of substations); ground transportation and
   traffic infrastructure; geological aspects (terrain stability, erosion
   of the soil); seismological activity of the terrain, conformity of urban
   planning with respect to protection of natural disasters, protection of
   cultural and historic heritage; touristic regions, zones and locations;
   biological diversity including the fatalities of birds and bats from
   collisions with wind turbines; etc. In addition, software Arc GIS is
   applied also for analysis of the crossing points with respect to the
   existing and planned transmission power lines on 110 kV, 220 kV and 400
   kV, but also with proposed oil-pipeline AMBO, constructed oil-pipeline
   Thessaloniki-Skopje, new proposed route of the pipeline, by applying
   safety measures and minimum allowed distance.},

Abstract = {The Project ``MAR VASTO{''} (Risk Management in Valparaiso/Manejo de
   Riesgos en Valparaiso), funded by BID/IADB (Banco InterAmericano de
   Desarrollo/InterAmerican Development Bank), has been managed by ENEA,
   with an Italian/Chilean joined partnership and the support of local
   institutions. Valparaiso tells the never-ending story of a tight
   interaction between society and environment and the city has been
   declared a Patrimony of Humanity by UNESCO since 2003. The main goals of
   the project have been to evaluate in the Valparaiso urban area the
   impact of main hazards (earthquake, tsunami, fire, and landslide),
   defining scenarios and maps on a geo-referenced GIS database. In
   particular, for earthquake hazard assessment the realistic modelling of
   ground motion is a very important base of knowledge for the preparation
   of groundshaking scenarios which serve as a valid and economic tool to
   be fruitfully used by civil engineers, supplying a particularly powerful
   tool for the prevention aspects of Civil Defense. When numerical
   modelling is successfully compared with records (as in the case of the
   Valparaiso, 1985 earthquake), the resulting synthetic seismograms permit
   the generation of groundshaking maps, based upon a set of possible
   scenario earthquakes. Where no recordings are available for the scenario
   event, synthetic signals can be used to estimate ground motion without
   having to wait for a strong earthquake to occur (pre-disaster
   microzonation). For the tsunami hazard, the available reports, {[}e.g.,
   SHOA (1999) Carta de Inundacion por Tsunami para la bahia de Valparaiso,
   Chile, http://www.shoa.cl/servicios/citsu/citsu.php], have been used as
   the reference documents for the hazard assessment for the Valparaiso
   site. The deep and detailed studies already carried out by SHOA have
   been complemented with (a) sets of parametric studies of the
   tsunamigenic potential of the 1985 and 1906 scenario earthquakes; and
   (b) analytical modelling of tsunami waveforms for different scenarios,
   in order to provide a complementary dataset to be used for the tsunami
   hazard assessment at Valparaiso. In addition, other targeted activities
   have been carried out, such as architectonic/urban planning
   studies/vulnerability evaluation for a pilot building stock in a
   historic area and a vulnerability analysis for three monumental
   churches. In this paper, a general description of the work is given,
   taking into account the in situ work that drove the suggestion of
   guidelines for mitigation actions.},

Title = {Seasonal Change in Wetland Coherence as an Aid to Wetland Monitoring},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Water is an essential natural resource, and information about surface
   water conditions can support a wide variety of applications, including
   urban planning, agronomy, hydrology, electrical power generation,
   disaster relief, ecology and preservation of natural areas. Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) is recognized as an important source of data for
   monitoring surface water, especially under inclement weather conditions,
   and is used operationally for flood mapping applications. The canopy
   penetration capability of the microwaves also allows for mapping of
   flooded vegetation as a result of enhanced backscatter from what is
   generally believed to be a double-bounce scattering mechanism between
   the water and emergent vegetation. Recent investigations have shown
   that, under certain conditions, the SAR response signal from flooded
   vegetation may remain coherent during repeat satellite over-passes,
   which can be exploited for interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements to
   estimate changes in water levels and water topography. InSAR results
   also suggest that coherence change detection (CCD) might be applied to
   wetland monitoring applications. This study examines wetland vegetation
   characteristics that lead to coherence in RADARSAT-2 InSAR data of an
   area in eastern Canada with many small wetlands, and determines the
   annual variation in the coherence of these wetlands using multi-temporal
   radar data. The results for a three-year period demonstrate that most
   swamps and marshes maintain coherence throughout the ice-/snow-free time
   period for the 24-day repeat cycle of RADARSAT-2. However, open water
   areas without emergent aquatic vegetation generally do not have suitable
   coherence for CCD or InSAR water level estimation. We have found that
   wetlands with tree cover exhibit the highest coherence and the least
   variance; wetlands with herbaceous cover exhibit high coherence, but
   also high variability of coherence; and wetlands with shrub cover
   exhibit high coherence, but variability intermediate between treed and
   herbaceous wetlands. From this knowledge, we have developed a novel
   image product that combines information about the magnitude of coherence
   and its variability with radar brightness (backscatter intensity). This
   product clearly displays the multitude of small wetlands over a wide
   area. With an interpretation key we have also developed, it is possible
   to distinguish different wetland types and assess year-to-year changes.
   In the next few years, satellite SAR systems, such as the European
   Sentinel and the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), will
   provide rapid revisit capabilities and standard data collection modes,
   enhancing the operational application of SAR data for assessing wetland
   conditions and monitoring water levels using InSAR techniques.},

Title = {Multi-Class Strategies for Joint Building Footprint and Road Detection
   in Remote Sensing},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building footprints and road networks are important inputs for a great
   deal of services. For instance, building maps are useful for urban
   planning, whereas road maps are essential for disaster response
   services. Traditionally, building and road maps are manually generated
   by remote sensing experts or land surveying, occasionally assisted by
   semi-automatic tools. In the last decade, deep learning-based approaches
   have demonstrated their capabilities to extract these elements
   automatically and accurately from remote sensing imagery. The building
   footprint and road network detection problem can be considered a
   multi-class semantic segmentation task, that is, a single model performs
   a pixel-wise classification on multiple classes, optimizing the overall
   performance. However, depending on the spatial resolution of the imagery
   used, both classes may coexist within the same pixel, drastically
   reducing their separability. In this regard, binary decomposition
   techniques, which have been widely studied in the machine learning
   literature, are proved useful for addressing multi-class problems.
   Accordingly, the multi-class problem can be split into multiple binary
   semantic segmentation sub-problems, specializing different models for
   each class. Nevertheless, in these cases, an aggregation step is
   required to obtain the final output labels. Additionally, other novel
   approaches, such as multi-task learning, may come in handy to further
   increase the performance of the binary semantic segmentation models.
   Since there is no certainty as to which strategy should be carried out
   to accurately tackle a multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation
   problem, this paper performs an in-depth study to shed light on the
   issue. For this purpose, open-access Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery
   (at 10 m) are considered for extracting buildings and roads, making use
   of the well-known U-Net convolutional neural network. It is worth
   stressing that building and road classes may coexist within the same
   pixel when working at such a low spatial resolution, setting a
   challenging problem scheme. Accordingly, a robust experimental study is
   developed to assess the benefits of the decomposition strategies and
   their combination with a multi-task learning scheme. The obtained
   results demonstrate that decomposing the considered multi-class remote
   sensing semantic segmentation problem into multiple binary ones using a
   One-vs.-All binary decomposition technique leads to better results than
   the standard direct multi-class approach. Additionally, the benefits of
   using a multi-task learning scheme for pushing the performance of binary
   segmentation models are also shown.},

Abstract = {Traditional methods of crop monitoring in the field need to lay various
   sensors and complex circuits in the field with a bad environment.
   Usually, the problems of time-consuming, labor-consuming, high
   maintenance cost and more or less damage to plants arise. Unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) spectral imaging technology is a new and fast
   technology for monitoring farmland environment, which combines an
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remote sensing sensors, real-time image
   transmission and other means. It can quickly obtain real-time spectral
   images of farmland crops. Usually, it can analyze images to obtain the
   growth information of farmland crops. The application of this technology
   catches up with the above problems. Firstly, the spectrum imaging
   technology of UAV is summarized, and the advantages of UAV application
   are introduced. Compared with traditional satellite remote sensing
   monitoring platform, UAV can work at a lower altitude, i. e. 80 similar
   to 400 m. It can resist the disadvantage of adverse weather and clouds,
   and achieve fast and accurate acquisition of high-precision images. At
   present, the application of small UAVs at home and abroad mainly focuses
   on disaster monitoring, natural resources monitoring, urban planning and
   vegetation monitoring. In addition, due to its low cost, near real-time
   image acquisition and other characteristics, in the development of
   precision agriculture, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spectral images are
   more commonly used. Secondly, the characteristics and application
   scenarios of common spectral images are analyzed. Panchromatic images
   are mostly used for data fusion because of their high resolution;
   multispectral and hypersecretion images are combined with spectral
   characteristics of crops due to their abundant spectral information,
   which can be used for the detection of biological and chemical
   indicators of crops, early warning of agricultural disasters, yield
   prediction and fine classification mapping; and thermal infrared images
   can be used for monitoring field drought because they can obtain crop
   temperature information. Then the main application ways of UAV spectral
   image technology in the field are summarized. At present, the main
   methods of monitoring crops using UAV spectral image technology are :
   using spectral reflectance to construct vegetation index or red edge
   parameters, or studying the reflection characteristics of vegetation,
   constructing crop growth model, using multiple linear regression,
   partial least squares method, in-depth learning and other biochemical
   parameters of crops to establish a model for inversion. Finally,
   shortcomings of UAV spectral imaging technology in the field application
   are discussed, and the future development prospects of this new
   technology have prospected, in order to provide a reference for the
   derivative application of UAV spectral imaging technology in the field.},

Title = {An evaluation of the relationship between urban resilience and urban
   regeneration based on urban density and social infrastructure value: The
   case of Kayseri},

Abstract = {Since the turn of the century, there have been significant changes in
   the field of planning and in the practices carried out for the sake of
   ``urban regeneration{''} in Turkey that merit analysis. The most
   important of these changes are represented by urban regeneration
   projects introduced to mitigate disaster risk and increasing the quality
   of urban life. Urban regeneration projects in Turkey continue to develop
   through segmental plan changes that lack scientific justification. This
   type of approach not only leads to population growth exceeding the
   figures predicted in the upper scale plan decisions of the city but also
   reduces the green areas, education and health infrastructure, social
   facilities, and cultural facilities associated with population growth.
   This pattern tends to compel people to live in a city where the quality
   of urban life has declined. Increasing population density through
   segmental and project-based urban regeneration prac-tices and
   deteriorating social due to density are the main reasons behind the
   diminished resil-ience of urban systems.
   This paper analyses the relationship between ``urban resilience{''} and
   ``urban regeneration{''} based on a field study conducted in Kayseri.
   The study examines the problems of increased urban density and the
   incompatibility of the social infrastructure (in terms of adequacy and
   location). To this end, all areas defined as ``highly risky{''} between
   2012 and 2020 in Kayseri in accordance with the Law on the
   Transformation of Areas under Disaster Risk No.6306 were analysed.
   Within the scope of the study, we examined the construction plan and
   plan expla-nation reports and found a ``population growth rate{''} by
   comparing the population figures before and after the implementation of
   the transformation plan. Then we assessed how the population density
   increase reflects on the building density increase based on the
   ``precedent/ building density change{''}. From the plan explanation
   report, we obtained the change in the overall social infrastructure
   ratio brought about by population growth and examined this figure on the
   basis of m(2) per capita.
   In the examined projects, an average 47\% increase was noted in the
   local population as a result of the plans, with the highest increase
   being 84\%. In addition, an average 2.08 times increase was witnessed in
   building density, with the highest increase being eight-fold. As for
   social in-frastructure areas, the average decrease in the square meters
   per capita was 20\% in the studied projects, with the the most
   significant drop being 38\%. While 40\% of the social infrastructure
   areas in the projects were preserved, 10\% were completely removed, and
   new proposals were made. Furthermore, 40\% underwent a partial change in
   either size or location, and no new proposals were made in the remaining
   10\% of the social infrastructure areas. These findings indicate that
   the maintenance of standards, mitigation of risk and provision of urban
   resilience, which are the main objectives of the Disaster Law, have not
   been largely achieved. Deterioration of the standards for social
   infrastructure area together with the increase in population and
   building density rates and changes in their function or location
   properties create open area inadequacy risks in areas to be used as a
   potential assembly and discharge point in possible disasters and states
   of emergency. These developments also mean new risk levels depending on
   different usage incompatibilities in areas such as the city centre
   (Sahabiye Phase 1 and 2 projects) and industrial zone (Anbar project
   area), which have higher development and daytime population utilisation
   density rates. In addition, various threats such as the problems that
   may be caused by potential building demolitions and night/day population
   differences may cause urban texture risks, which can have an impact on
   the vulnerability of urban infrastructure. When open and green areas
   within the social infrastructure areas are associated with building
   density and building order within the dense urban texture and are
   designed with sufficient vegetation, there may also be advantages in
   terms of air circulation, the feeding of underground water resources
   during precipitation, and reducing the urban heat island effect in
   extreme temperatures. However, the above-mentioned adverse factors lead
   to a decrease in the adaptation capacity of cities in the face of
   possible disturbances. The resilience of cities will gradually decrease
   if risk reduction is understood and implemented based only on the market
   mechanism in high-risk areas and with an approach that only increases
   urban density. This research offers substantial insight into the
   emerging problems and adaptation capacities of cities by analysing the
   relationship between urban regeneration and urban resilience based on
   the findings of a field study, which represents the original value of
   the study.},

Abstract = {Two million people will die in earthquakes in the twenty-first century
   assuming no increase in the average annual rate of deaths from the
   twentieth century. The economic result is a financial loss of five
   trillion dollars to the world's economy in current dollar terms, and
   probably a comparable but lower financial figure for the building
   losses. This human economic loss represents six quarters of US
   government consumption on defense and non-defense spending, or about
   twenty-times the period in Australian gross domestic product terms. The
   probable largest fatal earthquake, defined as the probable century event
   with a one percent probability in the century, will have a death toll in
   the range of three-hundred-thousand to one million people, coupled with
   a significant loss of dwellings, factories, and production capacity for
   the city that bears this disaster. The death toll will be as high as
   thirty percent of the population in the peak felt intensity region of
   the earthquake zone. Two to three earthquakes in this century will have
   death tolls in the range of one hundred to three-hundred-thousand
   people. There are one-hundred and twenty-five urban areas that have
   sufficient population and population density to sustain a loss of the
   one million people. The bulk of these one-hundred and twenty-five urban
   areas are located in the intraplate regions of the world including the
   Central and Eastern United States (twenty five), Australia (two),
   Europe, China, and India. Interplate earthquakes occur on the edges of
   the major tectonic plates, whilst intraplate earthquakes occur within
   the tectonic plates. This distinct geologic feature between interplate
   and intraplate means that an earthquake with a Richter magnitude of six
   in an interplate region, such as Kobe, has about the equivalent
   destructive power as a Richter 5.2 in an intraplate region, such as
   Sydney or New York. Three significant issues arise for planning for a
   city, such as Sydney, Australia or New York, to deal with this fatal
   event. The first issue is that the probability of the major event
   occurring in each one of the one-hundred and twenty-five urban areas is
   poorly understood. The historical earthquake and geologic data does not
   support reducing the probability of each of the one-hundred and
   twenty-five urban area of suffering from this major event from the
   average of 0.8 percent without investigating the probability
   distribution of deaths of the preceding two millennia. The second issue
   is how to develop the key components of an interdisciplinary planning
   strategy for a compact major urban area to mitigate the losses in a
   probable century event. The third issue is to equitably deal with this
   loss from the world insurance perspective. This paper outlines the
   preliminary research into these three issues from a town planning
   perspective using Sydney, Australia as the city example. (c) 2004

Abstract = {The paper offers a study on the phenomenon of the absence of
   historically and mentally expressed center in the city that was
   artificially assembled at different city planning stages from three
   self-sufficient and autonomous territorial units - districts. It focuses
   on the city of Togliatti located in the Volga Region of Russia, which
   can serve as a case study for many Russian cities built in the period of
   the country's active industrial development over the last half century.
   Togliatti is a unique territorial phenomenon, which has not obtained the
   recognition and status of a full-fledged city until now. And that is in
   spite of all kinds of possible top-notch epithets: city-experiment,
   citylaboratory, and city-utopia. ``Despite the fact that Togliatti
   sprang up from nothing, this city belongs to the Soviet tradition - the
   tradition to build new cities{''} {[}1, P.7].
   The paradoxical and contradictory nature of the object of the research
   creates a complicated precedent for reconciliation of ``pure{''} design
   ambitions with post-project reality, but it already occurs in the mode
   of a running socio-cultural ``disaster{''}. Having several stages of
   birth in its arsenal: from a fortress city ``Stavropol (the city of the
   Holy Cross){''} (in the 1830s) to the status of the largest
   mono-functional city (in the 1960s), Togliatti fails to work out a
   cultural genome of the continuity of generations, traditions, memory,
   and a special local urban lifestyle. It fails to bridge the existing gap
   between the city's provincial origin, which remained literally under
   water after flooding and the power plant construction, and the latest
   period of the actively developing ``working{''} city. It fails to show
   `` genius loci{''} that would consolidate the urban community, identify
   the territory and its inhabitants, make the city's unique public spaces
   once again available and open to collective communication.
   The creation of the `` core of urban balance{''} in a post-industrial
   city is a complex, provocative, and to a certain extent, a futuristic
   project. In our case, we are talking about the project partnership ``
   Museum Quarter Togliatti (MQT){''}, which is a conceptual idea of `` a
   city within a city{''} that can be projected in time and space on the ``
   zeroed out time axis{''} of almost a three-hundred-year history of
   Stavropol-Togliatti.
   According to the authors of the project, the central recreational axis
   in the so-called `` old town{''} is one of these key places. It divides
   the town's `` physical body{''} into two balanced parts and directly
   connects the present with the `` lost past{''}. A vast wasteland in the
   center on the urban-natural border provides benefits for the game with
   the `` pure idea{''} and the freedom of its materialization on a large
   scale similar to all urban initiatives that have been so far implemented
   in this area.},

Abstract = {During last decades, the international community has become aware of the
   need to adapt to the effects of climate change, as the sensitivity of
   natural and human systems gained relevance. Europe is one of the most
   urbanized regions, accounting for a 73\% of people living in urban
   areas. This share, together with the increase of urban land take, has
   concentrated the fight against climate change in cities, which are
   considered as one of the most vulnerable areas.
   European cities are characterised by a wide range of cultural heritage,
   which is commonly located in what is defined as the historic city. In
   order to protect urban heritage from a changing environment, emphasis
   should be given to the integration of conservation management and urban
   planning strategies, within wider goals of local sustainable
   development.
   Historic cities have a great potential in contributing to local economy
   and enhancing investment climate. Modern conservation strategies need to
   address a balance between urban growth and quality of life in a
   sustainable way. They should match the interrelationships of existing
   building stock, spatial organization, natural characteristics and
   social, cultural and economic values. Furthermore, the need to address a
   new generation of strategies, adapted to new climatic scenarios, should
   be considered as a priority for an effective management of the whole
   city. The proposed paper presents research results of the ADVICE
   project, based on a multiscale approach for the management of climate
   change impacts on cultural heritage located in the urban context.
   Vulnerability is addressed for different types of heritage, both at
   urban or building scale, considering their singularities as well as the
   context in which they are included. This will permit addressing the
   overall urban scale, together with data at structure level. Adaptive
   measures in general can be of a preventive character and improve
   resilience yet they can also offer preparative support when dealing with
   the anticipated effects of climate change and extreme events. In order
   to be effective, they need to be addressed according to the typology of
   object to be protected and to the scale of the impact or disaster they
   are facing. Vulnerability mapping is one of the first steps in
   clarifying the challenges which climate change pose for a city and its
   stakeholders. Assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability
   vary widely, depending on the subject, time frame, geographic coverage
   and purpose of the assessment. KPIs are therefore needed to address the
   overall as well as the specific vulnerability and exposure for risk
   scoring, in order to propose effective adaptive measures.
   Information is supported by a data model for the creation of an
   evidence-based decision making platform, which will contribute to a more
   educated and data-driven decision making process. This will permit
   eliminating one of the barriers to the effective implementation of
   climate change adaptation strategies by cultural heritage managers and
   public authorities.},

Title = {Classification method, spectral diversity, band combination and accuracy
   assessment evaluation for urban feature detection},

Abstract = {Automatic extraction of urban features from high resolution satellite
   images is one of the main applications in remote sensing. It is useful
   for wide scale applications, namely: urban planning, urban mapping,
   disaster management, GIS (geographic information systems) updating, and
   military target detection. One common approach to detecting urban
   features from high resolution images is to use automatic classification
   methods. This paper has four main objectives with respect to detecting
   buildings. The first objective is to compare the performance of the most
   notable supervised classification algorithms, including the maximum
   likelihood classifier (MLC) and the support vector machine (SVM). In
   this experiment the primary consideration is the impact of kernel
   configuration on the performance of the SVM. The second objective of the
   study is to explore the suitability of integrating additional bands,
   namely first principal component (1st PC) and the intensity image, for
   original data for multi classification approaches. The performance
   evaluation of classification results is done using two different
   accuracy assessment methods: pixel based and object based approaches,
   which reflect the third aim of the study. The objective here is to
   demonstrate the differences in the evaluation of accuracies of
   classification methods. Considering consistency, the same set of ground
   truth data which is produced by labeling the building boundaries in the
   GIS environment is used for accuracy assessment. Lastly, the fourth aim
   is to experimentally evaluate variation in the accuracy of classifiers
   for six different real situations in order to identify the impact of
   spatial and spectral diversity on results. The method is applied to
   Quickbird images for various urban complexity levels, extending from
   simple to complex urban patterns. The simple surface type includes a
   regular urban area with low density and systematic buildings with brick
   rooftops. The complex surface type involves almost all kinds of
   challenges, such as high dense build up areas, regions with bare soil,
   and small and large buildings with different rooftops, such as concrete,
   brick, and metal.
   Using the pixel based accuracy assessment it was shown that the percent
   building detection (PBD) and quality percent (QP) of the MLC and SVM
   depend on the complexity and texture variation of the region. Generally,
   PBD values range between 70\% and 90\% for the MLC and SVM,
   respectively. No substantial improvements were observed when the SVM and
   MLC classifications were developed by the addition of more variables,
   instead of the use of only four bands. In the evaluation of object based
   accuracy assessment, it was demonstrated that while MLC and SVM provide
   higher rates of correct detection, they also provide higher rates of
   false alarms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional terrain data have a wide range of applications in
   urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster prediction, game
   entertainment and many other fields. With the development of science and
   technology and the progress of cognitive psychology, displaying
   technology has also been improved to fulfill the demand of humans, and
   promotes the rapid development of three-dimensional display technology.
   Nowadays, the visualization technology of three-dimensional terrain is a
   research hotspot in related fields.
   Through the terrain data model building, simulation and
   three-dimensional displaying, a variety of techniques have been used to
   achieve the display of three-dimensional terrain. The three-dimensional
   display is a technique for displaying three-dimensional images with the
   medium of two-dimensional plane, which can visually present the
   different angles and depth information of object and bring the realism
   close to the objective world. The effect is very similar to people's
   visual and cognitive habits, which makes it accepted as an ideal real
   three-dimensional display technology. How to realize the visualization
   of 3D terrain data without any special glasses or relying on electronic
   display devices is the research topic of this paper.
   In this paper, a method of combining Fourier holography with full
   parallax holographic stereogram is presented to realize the display of
   three-dimensional terrain by making full parallax hologram. Firstly, the
   SRTM terrain (elevation) data is processed, the three-dimensional
   digital model of terrain is established and then is sampled according to
   the principle of holographic stereogram, and thus a two-dimensional
   image array containing parallax information is obtained. Then, according
   to the holographic diffraction formula, the image transformation of
   two-dimensional image array is carried out to meets the requirement of
   Fourier holographic transform. Finally, the holographic recording optics
   setup is designed and the following procedures are take: laser beam is
   divided into object beam and reference beam, Fourier transform are
   involved in the procession of object beam, interference between the
   reference light beam and the Fourier transform image is recorded in the
   focus point of the objective lens, a microscopic objective with large NA
   is used to achieve enough view angle, images need to be recorded are
   displayed one at a time by a LCOS light modulator, under the position of
   the precision platform every unit of the hologram is recorded
   automatically, precisely and effectively. After post - processing, the
   three-dimensional topographic hologram with large view field and full
   parallax are accomplished.
   The method presented in this paper realizes the efficient automatic
   production of three-dimensional topographic hologram based on SRTM
   terrain data. Under the white light illumination, using the
   large-view-field and full-parallax three-dimensional hologram display,
   the elevation data of the terrain are displayed intuitively, accurately,
   clearly and delicately, which is of great significance for the research
   of high quality and large field holographic three-dimensional display,
   and has practical application value in Landform Surveying, commodity
   exhibition, anti-counterfeiting, advertising and so on.},
