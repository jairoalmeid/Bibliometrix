J	Wamsler, C				Wamsler, Christine			Mainstreaming risk reduction in urban planning and housing: a challenge for international aid organisations	DISASTERS			English	Article						developing countries; disaster; housing; prevention; risk reduction; urban planning		The effects of 'natural' disasters in cities can be worse than in other environments, with poor and marginalised urban communities in the developing world being most at risk. To avoid post-disaster destruction and the forced eviction of these communities, proactive and preventive urban planning, including housing, is required. This paper examines current perceptions and practices within international aid organisations regarding the existing and potential roles of urban planning as a tool for reducing disaster risk. It reveals that urban planning confronts many of the generic challenges to mainstreaming risk reduction in development planning. However, it faces additional barriers. The main reasons for the identified lack of integration of urban planning and risk reduction are, first, the marginal position of both fields within international aid organisations, and second, an incompatibility between the respective professional disciplines. To achieve better integration, a conceptual shift from conventional to non-traditional urban planning is proposed. This paper suggests related operative measures and initiatives to achieve this change.

J	Park, K; Oh, H; Won, JH				Park, Kiyong; Oh, Hoo; Won, Jeong-hun			Analysis of disaster resilience of urban planning facilities on urban flooding vulnerability	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Resilience; Urban flood; Urban planning facilities; Vulnerability	EXTREME EVENTS; CLIMATE; MITIGATION; MODEL	Rainfall continues to increase due to the influence of global warming and is resulting in an increase in flood damage. The purpose of this study is to propose an approach for reducing urban flood damage and improving urban resilience. Urban flooding vulnerability analysis used land use and building characteristics as evaluation indicators. Disaster resilience analysis of urban planning facilities focused on urban and spatial aspects. The results of these analyses were overlapped to analyze whether urban planning facilities were properly located in areas vulnerable to urban flooding. The result of mapping the two results showed that there are some urban planning facilities with low resilience in the Red Zone, the central commercial area of Changwon, which has the highest vulnerability. This zone should have the appropriate placement of high-resilience facilities, such as disaster prevention facilities and space facilities. This study proposes a method to minimize flood damage in urban space. This system can cope with and systematically manage flood damage by increasing disaster resilience through appropriate land use planning and site selection for urban planning facilities.

J	Le Blanc, A				Le Blanc, Antoine			THE CONSERVATION OF TRAUMATIC RUINS: A SENSITIVE ISSUE TO IMPROVE URBAN RESILIENCE	GEOGRAPHIA POLONICA			English	Article						risks; catastrophe; ruins; conservation; resilience		Preserved urban ruins convey a social and political message, sometimes with great impact. Whereas stake-holders often tend to cancel the traces of disaster, the conservation of ruins has been the consequence of much disputed decisions. Such decisions can be explained by the will to use the conservation of ruins as a preventive tool. Indeed, the conservation of a disaster's traumatic marks can be a tool to perform urban resilience, since the urban system integrates the trauma, in an open purpose of risk mitigation. However, this instrument of risk management entails major urban planning issues. Many municipalities in various countries have decided to preserve ruins after tragic events. They set up specific restoration and management standards, various aesthetic and technical choices, access and presentation criteria, but they also indicate a political exploitation of the disaster.

J	Farbol, R				Farbol, Rosanna			Urban civil defence: imagining, constructing and performing nuclear war in Aarhus	URBAN HISTORY			English	Article							RESISTANCE	During the Cold War, cities were seen as likely targets of modern total warfare and systems of civil defence were created to protect cities and their inhabitants. Yet existing civil defence histories have focused little on the specifically urban aspect, and urban historians likewise have paid civil defence little attention. Using Aarhus, Denmark, as a case-study, this article examines civil defence through planning, practices and materiality in a specific urban landscape. By analysing how civil defence was organized, performed and built in Denmark, the article sheds light on the mutual imbrication of urban planning, geography and materiality and local civil defence. I argue that through biopolitics, local civil defence authorities imagineered an idealized survivalist community of city dwellers who would pull together to protect and save their city and that this contributed to taming an incomprehensible, global, nuclear catastrophe into a manageable, localized, urban calamity.

It is argued that the city was modified from two processes: 1) The effects of urban planning (generated by the idea of an ideal city); 2) the disaster effects (generated by the actual city). From these two processes, this text evidences that the strategies of the Urban and Regional Planning of Blumenau constitute social markers of the segregating effect of disasters. In order to develop this argument the text is structured in three main sections: 1) The formation and urban development of Blumenau; 2) disasters and the myth of urban expansion to the Northern Region; 3) the relationship between disasters and the limits of Urban Planning.

The issue of disaster prevention and control is currently attracting increasing attention, reflected in the rising number of publications now available on this subject. This paper takes Kitakyushu city in Japan as case study to carry out an evaluation for urban refuge system. Firstly, geographical information system technology (GIS) is used to establish databases of refuge area, refuge road and refuge people. Subsequently, this paper emphatically investigates urban population, building and road of the refuge area in Kitakyushu. Finally, the buffer analysis of GIS technology is used to evaluate the present condition of existing refuge system based on results of the urban planning analysis, and then establishment of new refuge area is discussed according to the evaluation results. This research integrates GIS technology to set up disaster prevention planning based on disaster prevention information and urban planning investigation. The proposed assessment technique can provide safe disaster prevention information and reassuring service for the resident in Kitakyushu.

As urban space has become the central aspect of modern societies creating new types of vulnerabilities, resilience has emerged as a key priority for urban planners as well as civil protection officers aiming to build smart and more disaster resilient cities. There is a large set of urban planning practices, such as hazard mapping and building permits, aiming at increasing urban disaster resilience. However, there is still a lack of endeavour to research how these urban planning processes are being incorporated into national civil protection systems. Therefore, this paper aims to bridge the gap and analyses the relationship between urban planning and civil protection in conceptualizing resilient space planning processes. In this paper, using a case study approach, we examine if and how, the Danish Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) integrates urban planning and civil protection in Denmark in order to build more resilient cities. To do this, we draw upon the knowledge of those working within the urban planning and civil protection systems to identify the opportunities and obstacles for the existence of their cooperation. Copenhagen, ranked the world's most climate resilient city, was selected for the urban planning case analysis, as well as Vejle, being part of the "100 Resilient Cities" network. The results indicate that although both DEMA and urban planners aim to build disaster resilient cities and wish to contribute to creating a more resilient society, the dialogue between the two bodies is almost non-existent with regards to resilient urban space planning processes.

However it must be paid more attention in new urban planning because destructive earthquakes due to the activities of a fault may result in immeasurable losses. Therefore, the location of buried faults, especially in the near surface, is of considerable importance with respect to the new urban planning and disaster reduction. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), which can have an effective depth of investigation of several hundred meters, has been applied to the detection of buried faults in urban areas on the China mainland since 2001, and has proven to be one of the most powerful geophysical tools for this application. Here we inferred the presence, location and width of Pudu River fault zone in Yuxi basin using ERT, and then proposed our suggestions on the new urban planning of Yuxi city.

Crowdsourcing as a Tool for Urban Emergency Management: Lessons from the Literature and Typology	SENSORS			English	Review						crowdsourcing; emergency management; quality control in crowdsourcing; systematic literature review; task design; urban planning	SOCIAL MEDIA; DISASTER; AWARENESS; IMPACTS	Recently, citizen involvement has been increasingly used in urban disaster prevention and management, taking advantage of new ubiquitous and collaborative technologies. This scenario has created a unique opportunity to leverage the work of crowds of volunteers. As a result, crowdsourcing approaches for disaster prevention and management have been proposed and evaluated. However, the articulation of citizens, tasks, and outcomes as a continuous flow of knowledge generation reveals a complex ecosystem that requires coordination efforts to manage interdependencies in crowd work. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper extends to the context of urban emergency management the results of a previous study that investigates how crowd work is managed in crowdsourcing platforms applied to urban planning. The goal is to understand how crowdsourcing techniques and quality control dimensions used in urban planning could be used to support urban emergency management, especially in the context of mining-related dam outages. Through a systematic literature review, our study makes a comparison between crowdsourcing tools designed for urban planning and urban emergency management and proposes a five-dimension typology of quality in crowdsourcing, which can be leveraged for optimizing urban planning and emergency management processes.

J	Orhan, E				Orhan, Ezgi			The consequences of security cognition in post-disaster urban planning practices in the case of Turkey	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Review						Natural disasters; Security; Fragmentation; Urban planning; Turkey	HAZARD MITIGATION; RECOVERY; EARTHQUAKES; DISASTER	This paper synthesis the literature on risk and disaster paradigms and evaluates the disaster management system of Turkey by presenting the post-disaster urban planning practices. The threat of nature on human being and their artefacts establishes risk cognition and becomes one of the main concerns of societies due to the social and economic costs. The change in the perception of risk has led to revise the disaster management paradigms at international level in 1990s. The traditional disaster paradigms see the physical world as an externality causing damage on human environment, thus the aim of this thought is to reduce losses caused by disasters. Seeing the shortcomings of traditional approaches, the changing conceptualization of disasters concludes to contemporary approaches, which assume that pre-disaster policies lead to rationalization of resource allocation and increase efficiency of investments made to reduce risks. However, a disaster management system dominated by traditional view, which focuses on direct impacts of disasters and ignores the secondary effects, leads to employment of resources in an irregular way without predicting possible consequences. In the disaster management approach of Turkey, the security concern of the traditional approach produces permanent housing in geologically safer districts, which causes the problem of fragmentation of urban space. Adapazari and Van, earthquake-hit cities of Turkey, exemplify the post-disaster urban setting of a traditional disaster management approach. Along with the literature, post-disaster practices of Turkey reveal that the security concern result in generation of new settlement districts posing new problems such as fragmentation of urban bodies, alienation of new settlements from historicity of existing town and isolation of urban public culture.

The Ravenna Case Study	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						resilience; adaptive capacity; cultural heritage; risk management; climate change; urban planning; planning tool; Ravenna	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; CHANGE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CHALLENGES; REDUCTION; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK	As increasingly recognized by scholars, climate change is posing new challenges in the field of disaster risk management and urban planning. Even though cultural heritage has passed through decades and centuries, it has never experienced such unexpected and variable events as those forecasted by climate change for the foreseeable future, making it a sensitive element of the living environment. By selecting the city of Ravenna and the cultural heritage site of the Santa Croce Church and archaeological area as a case study, the paper aims at providing an insight into the role that urban planning tools have when it comes to improving the resilience of historical areas, coping with climate change through improvements to the disaster risk management of cultural heritage. Starting from a deep analysis of the existing spatial and urban planning tools that operate at different scales on the Ravenna territory, the adaptive capacity of the historical area toward the identified risks was assessed. The results may lead, on the one hand, to improving the integration of cultural heritage risk management into urban planning tools; on the other hand, they contribute to improving the scope and the governance of the heritage management plans in order to cope with climate change risks and their effects.

J	Kondo, T; Lizarralde, G				Kondo, Tamiyo; Lizarralde, Gonzalo			Maladaptation, fragmentation, and other secondary effects of centralized post-disaster urban planning: The case of the 2011 "cascading" disaster in Japan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Post-disaster urban planning; Mitigation measures; Urban footprint; Internal migration; The Great East Japan Earthquake	HOUSING RECOVERY; EARTHQUAKE; RECONSTRUCTION; RESILIENCE; TOHOKU; TERM	Previous studies have documented the negative impacts and unexpected secondary effects of post-disaster housing development. Here, we build on this tradition to explore how post-disaster urban planning and risk mitigation measures affect internal migrations after a major disaster. In the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, the Japanese government put forward significant efforts to provide safe housing and land in more than 20 cities. We used GIS spatial analysis to identify urban footprint changes, which proved to be reliable indicators of internal migration. Our results reveal the secondary effects of planning interventions, and more specifically, how the maladaptation measures triggered rapid urban sprawl and increased risks of landslides and vulnerabilities in mountainous areas. We also find increased urban fragmentation, both socially and spatially. Maladaptation, urban fragmentation, and rapid changes in urban footprints emerged as the consequences of centralized government-mandated planning and housing development. We conclude that the uncertainty surrounding dynamic recovery processes requires incremental adaptive action. Planners and local authorities must recognize and remain attentive to the cascading effects of centralized planning decisions.

First, the authors offer their conception of planning for resiliency as a goal for recovering communities, and the benefits of planning in efforts to create more resilient places. Next, they discuss major issues associated with planning for postdisaster recovery, including barriers posed by federal and state governments to planning for resiliency, the promise and risks of compact urban form models for guiding rebuilding, and the failure to involve citizens in planning for disasters. Finally, they discuss lessons from prior research that address these issues and policy recommendations that foster predisaster recovery planning for resilient communities.

J	Scholz, W; Stober, T; Sassen, H				Scholz, Wolfgang; Stober, Tim; Sassen, Hannah			Are Urban Planning Schools in the Global South Prepared for Current Challenges of Climate Change and Disaster Risks?	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						higher urban planning education; curricula development; climate change; disaster risks; Sub-Saharan Africa; South East Asia		This article undertakes an analysis of current urban planning programs at universities with a focus on sub-Saharan English-speaking African (SSA) and South East Asian countries (SEA) as comparison cases. The aim is to identify, as an important part of sustainability, the existence and share of climate change and disaster related courses in the curricula, and to understand to what extent these topics are already integrated into current urban planning programs at the university level and thus shape the knowledge and skills of future urban planners. The local academic and professional environments in which the programs are based are taken into account by a review of the historical development of the programs. The analysis in mid-2020 took only those universities and programs into account that have curricula and course titles available online. The data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The second part of the research deals with the discussion of how these courses can be best integrated into the existing curricula and thus serve the adequate education of urban planners by providing some concrete ideas.

J	Parthasarathy, D				Parthasarathy, D.			Decentralization, pluralization, balkanization? Challenges for disaster mitigation and governance in Mumbai	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Disaster governance; Pluralization; Decentralization; Balkanization; Mumbai floods	URBAN	This paper critiques the three interlinked but distinct processes of pluralization, decentralization, and balkanization in relating urban planning and governance problems to disaster mitigation and governance. Using flood-related disasters in Mumbai as a case study, the paper analyzes the disaster governance initiatives of urban and regional institutions in the Mumbai region. Balkanization of institutions and governance mechanisms pertaining to urban planning and disaster management is identified as a key barrier to effective decentralized disaster governance in the city and its region. Three types of balkanization are described and critiqued: a) spatial/geographical (balkanization of ecosystem and environmental management); b) sectoral (balkanization of urban governance sectors solid-waste, drainage and sewerage, pollution control, infrastructure); and c) institutional (balkanization of urban and disaster mitigation/management institutions). Attention to issues of scale and cross-institutional linkages are identified as key areas for addressing the balkanization problem. Issues of informality are foregrounded as contradictory features affecting the quality of decentralized disaster governance, and as one of the neo-liberal mechanisms of urban entrepreneurial governance.

J	Ozyetgin Altun, A; Ogdul, HG				Ozyetgin Altun, Ayse; Ogdul, Hurriyet Gulsun			URBAN PLANNING IN RELATION TO DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT: THE PLANS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATIONS IN ISTANBUL	METU JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						Disaster reduction and management; urban planning; Istanbul; areas under disaster risk; disaster risk analysis		The main question of this study is whether urban planning plays an active role in disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) or not in Turkey. Golcuk and Duzce Earthquakes in Turkey (1999) showed the problem of unplanned urbanization has caused great suffering and economic loss in a striking way. At the same time, it was understood how administrations and society were unprepared for disasters with only the emergency response method. Then the last twenty years have attempted to maintain the process in parallel DRRM directions with international perspective and great progress has been made in Turkey. However, this research was developed with the concern that similar development was not recorded in the urban planning regulation and practice. Urban planning is a tool to support spatial damage reduction and development of social knowledge and awareness to realize the DRRM process. Accordingly, the determination of land use decisions and construction conditions, as well as ensuring participation in the production of planning decisions to cover various social sub-groups are directly within the scope of risk reduction. In this study, how the concepts and methods defined within the scope of DRRM are developed and applied through urban planning have been accepted as indicators in measuring how much DRRM can be achieved. Accordingly, the documents developed in the country and local scale within the scope of DRRM after the 1999 Golcuk and Duzce earthquakes were examined in depth which describe the role, content and application of urban planning in Turkey and Istanbul. The documents examined in the study recorded the developments in the period between 2000 and 2017. Documents examined on the national scale consist of laws, regulations, development plans and strategy documents. On the local scale, risk analysis reports made after the earthquake, master and environmental plans, as well as risky areas approved by law No. 6306 and developing transformation plans for these areas were examined in the case of Istanbul. As a result of the research, it has been determined that the conceptual and theoretical framework developed on a national scale is immature, local practices produce controversial results and cannot draw a clear framework. The results obtained due to this contradiction are urban planning has been manipulated with the discourse of risk reduction, have not focus on solving the problem yet, and the increasing in urbanization and population density in risky areas to cause increasing uncertainty in the city.

This paper firstly makes interpretation for social connotation of Double Reduction Studies suggest that to realize the effective urban planning system coping with the changes which double reduction bring with, we should change the traditional urban decision-making model and the role of urban planning. To establish two basic programining: frameworks, namely "mitigation" framework and "adaptation" framework, to meet the requirements. of Double-Reduction. Finally establish implementation framework of urban planning carrying out requirements or Double-Reduction, put Double-Reduction into planning practice.

J	Manda, MZ				Manda, Mtafu Zeleza			Where there is no local government: addressing disaster risk reduction in a small town in Malawi	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION			English	Article						disaster risk; hazards; urban planning; vulnerability		Disaster risk reduction (DRR) has become a major area of concern in the wake of increasing numbers of disasters. With rapid urbanization, both globally and locally, attention to the challenge of disaster risks has turned to urban settlements, where high densities and settlement patterns can, and do, create vulnerabilities. This paper presents an analysis of the hazards and risks that the town of Karonga in Malawi faces from earthquakes, floods, strong winds and drought, and considers locally appropriate methods to address these. It also discusses the limits of collaborative urban planning in this context, especially in light of the absence of an elected local government. Lessons from Karonga can inform the development of effective DRR mainstreaming tools in countries reliant on external support.

J	Felix, D; Monteiro, D; Feio, A				Felix, Daniel; Monteiro, Daniel; Feio, Artur			Estimating the needs for temporary accommodation units to improve predisaster urban planning in seismic risk cities	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Temporary housing units; Pre-disaster planning; Homeless; Temporary accommodation prediction; Earthquakes		Earthquakes have been destructive events for the built environment, particularly for urban areas due to the concentration of people and constructions. Two of the important effects are damaged or destroyed houses and the homeless. In these scenarios, the provision of temporary accommodation solutions is one of the most important post-disaster actions to provide for minimum living conditions. However, the implemented solutions frequently end in undesirable outcomes for victims and cities. Pre-disaster planning has been considered the best way to minimize consequences and promote better emergency management. This way, the paper presents a tool to estimate temporary accommodation units needs (TETAN) aiming to forecast necessities in terms of space and resources to supply temporary units after hypothetical scenarios of damage and destruction caused by earthquakes and defined according to the modified Mercalli Scale. The tool is assessed in two cities with high seismic risk, analysing and discussing the results, as well as suggesting measures and strategies which can be considered in the urban planning of both cases, not only for pre-disaster planning of temporary accommodation but also for built environmental risk reduction.

Multidimensional qualitative research method through document studies, historical analysis of destructive events and their stages, and case studies (Kabul, Afghanistan; Mostar, Bosnia and Banda Aceh, Indonesia). This research shows that existing efforts for events aftermath suffer from heavy dependency on foreign aids, marginalizing local context, and lack of proper coordination. The suggested framework comprises four major phases that have to be handled by good management including pre-after-the-event, emergency relief stage, transitional stage, and recovery phase. Sustainable urban planning needs to deal with these stages individually and holistically.

Based on urban planning perspective, the paper studied its sustainable development measures to respond climate change from integrated considerations of "retarding" and "adapting". The results demonstrate: in the first place, it should create new planning method to commonly retard and adapt climate change through pouring attention to the low-carbon planning method and negative planning method. In the second place, it should rationally ascertain its capacity and growth boundary to reduce the exposure degree and vulnerability, and explore new land-use mode to enhance the capability of responding climate change through distributing different lands scientifically. The last but not the least, it should reconstruct the urban spatial form to protect carbon sink space and defending disaster greenbelt on city scale, and consequently develop new-type community whose living function and production function are multiple, in addition, it's a "defending disaster community" whose safety facilities are complete and disaster-prevention space organization is orderly.

This idea is also considered to be a comprehensive concept for addressing the effects of climate change. In this case, flexible urban planning proposals were made and targets, measures and assessment procedures were tried and established in various areas such as urban planning, energy, transportation, health and welfare. According to the results, the corresponding measures and the emergency early warning treatment plan after the disaster are proposed to achieve the purpose of risk assessment.

Thus, it has been a hot issue in the field of urban planning research how to reduce the risk of cities and prevent the accidents by scientific planning. With the frequency and complexity of nowadays disasters, we should pay more attention to public safety planning. Public safety planning should pursue essentially safe cities. "Safety first, sustainable development" concepts should be incorporated in different steps for a comprehensive urban planning technical framework. It requires analysis for different urban disasters and evaluation of disasters on different population and land scales. This paper tries to discuss the importance of establishing the concept of safe city and highlights the idea of multiple planning, which includes safety layout planning, safety facility planning, emergency action planning and etc. On one hand, the author introduced the present studies, including different concepts of "safe city", research on urban defense aimed at a natural disaster's attack and urban disaster prevention. On the other hand, the paper prospected the research trends in the fields such as integration of urban defense and urban disaster prevention, emphasis on community and application of proper planning.

J	Leon, J; March, A				Leon, Jorge; March, Alan			Taking responsibility for 'shared responsibility': urban planning for disaster risk reduction across different phases. Examining bushfire evacuation in Victoria, Australia	INTERNATIONAL PLANNING STUDIES			English	Review							EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; NEIGHBORHOOD; INTERFACE; MODEL; FIRE	Urban planning has been increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for disaster risk reduction. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to translate this recognition into appropriate urban morphologies. Challenges still exist in working across the different phases involved in disaster management and in supporting the ongoing shift from top-down to shared responsibility risk reduction approaches. This paper examines these issues in the context of a bushfire emergency affecting three urban fringe communities in Bendigo, Victoria. The response activity of evacuation is studied with a computer agent-based model, demonstrating that: (1) complete evacuations take considerable time (30 min to 1 h); (2) urban form characteristics can have a noticeable impact on augmenting or decreasing this time and (3) it is possible for bushfires to overrun or surround settlements before this time. Existing 'leave early' policy is confirmed as appropriate, but further examination of the role of urban morphology during a bushfire disaster is required.

J	Echendu, A; Georgeou, N				Echendu, Adaku; Georgeou, Nichole			'Not Going to Plan': Urban Planning, Flooding, and Sustainability in Port Harcourt City, Nigeria	URBAN FORUM			English	Article						Urban planning; Flooding; Sustainable development; Urban planners; Environmental disasters	URBANIZATION; INFRASTRUCTURE; POLICY	Flooding is the most widespread environmental disaster in Nigeria and flooding impacts are exacerbated by poor urban planning. Flooding is a direct impediment to Nigeria achieving its sustainable development goals (SDGs). While urban planners are responsible for implementing policy changes to address the issue of flooding, there is very little research that explores their views on the linkages between urban planning, flooding, and public policy. Using the city of Port Harcourt, Nigeria, as a case study, this paper presents data from interviews with practicing urban planning professionals. It argues that Port Harcourt's urban planners have a sound understanding of principles of sustainability and are fully aware of the connections between poor urban planning and flooding. They do however see widespread public non-compliance with planning laws and improper building approvals, rather than systemic failures of governance, as the main issues that undermine the city's legal and planning architecture put in place to control floods.

J	Rivera, C; Wamsler, C				Rivera, Claudia; Wamsler, Christine			Integrating climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and urban planning: A review of Nicaraguan policies and regulations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Review						Disaster risk reduction; Climate change adaptation; Climate change; Policies; Regulatory frameworks; Urban planning; Mainstreaming; Nicaragua		The integration of risk reduction and climate change adaptation has become an urgent task in addressing increasing urban risk more effectively and efficiently. This paper analyses the extent to which climate change adaptation is integrated into the policies and regulatory frameworks that guide urban risk reduction in Nicaragua, and discusses related progress. The results reveal significant progress in integrating climate change adaptation into the policy and regulatory frameworks of the three relatively new fields of (a) disaster risk reduction, (b) environmental management and (c) urban planning. They show that differences in the degree of integration relate to the development and updates to policy instruments in each field, and the extent to which they are related to the implementation of international climate change agreements. Although initially climate change adaptation integration was focused on the protection of natural resources in general, and food production in particular, since 2008 authorities have shown increasing interest in a more comprehensive and integrated approach. Nevertheless, the integration of climate change adaptation into disaster risk reduction and urban planning still lags behind the advances made in the environmental management field, It is concluded that in order to achieve greater and more coherent integration of CCA and, ultimately, improve the way climate-related risks is dealt with, urban authorities need to systematically review current policies and regulations to assess the synergies and gaps.

J	Coetzee, C; Van Niekerk, D				Coetzee, Christo; Van Niekerk, Dewald			Towards a disaster risk assessment methodology for communities underlain by dolomite	DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk reduction; Vulnerability; Urban planning; Disaster risk; Dolomite; Risk assessment methodology	URBAN	Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to provide a robust and simple methodology for disaster risk management officials to assess the total disaster risk posed by dolomite in urban areas of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach - In order to develop the methodology the basic principles of disaster risk assessment, incapsulated in the notation R = H x V, was applied to provide a vehicle to quantify hazard and vulnerability aspects related to dolomite risk. Specifically existing knowledge on inherent dolomite risk classes (hazard component) was aligned to issues of vulnerability (in this case ageing water infrastructure) to attain a total dolomite disaster risk score for a specific area. Findings - The results from the practical application of the method indicated that the proposed dolomite risk assessment methodology is not only robust but easy to comprehend and to apply. The simplicity of the method also allows for easy integration into existing urban planning and integrated development planning process. Originality/value - The creation of the method not only provides a much-needed tool for assessing the total disaster risk posed by dolomite in urban areas but also adds value to the entire urban and community development process.

Design/methodology/approach - It presents itself as a post-catastrophe ethnography carried out from a specific approach, that is, the street ethnography that consists of collecting the practices and discourses of inhabitants, administrators, experts and commercial operators, which take place on or around the street. Findings - Illustrating the stages from the declaration of the state of emergency to the expertise-proposed reconstruction models, it shows the differences between resilient strategies and policies of urban management and resistant dwelling practices that are analyzed progressively focusing on a particular social group: the teenagers of the alleys. Research limitations/implications - Descending in the alleys means to take a micro-sight that ables to identify present living paths. Practical implications - Based on a long fieldwork, it bridges the gap between "theories" and practices, and it highlights those fields of action that despite being dominated by wide-ranging disaster management and urban planning logics bring out the work of social life in reweaving its threads in contexts of crisis. Social implications - Paying attention to a social portion that often escapes from ethnographic investigation, this study has the merit of dealing with teenagers in this kind of situation. Originality/value - Indeed, this part of society and its creative "culture" receive the focus of a few studies, especially in case of catastrophes.

As a response, novel sources of data combined with data-driven logics and advanced spatial modelling techniques have the potential for transformative change in the role of information in urban planning. However, little practical guidance exists on the potential opportunities offered by mobile phone data for enhancing adaptive capacities in urban areas. Building upon a review of spatial studies mobilizing mobile phone data, this paper explores the opportunities offered by such digital information for providing spatially-explicit assessments of urban vulnerability, and shows the ways these can help developing more dynamic strategies and tools for urban planning and disaster risk management. Finally, building upon the limitations of mobile phone data analysis, it discusses the key urban governance challenges that need to be addressed for supporting the emergence of transformative change in current planning frameworks.

In the urban planning context, the existence of numerous decision makers and alternatives, which are depending on many criteria, makes decision-making process difficult. This difficulty was overcomed through geographical information systems (GIS). In the context of GIS-based multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis, we used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to determine earthquake-risky areas in Yalova City Center. First, AHP analysis related to geological and superstructure/infrastructure criteria was conducted and two separate AHP maps were obtained. Then, we conducted TOPSIS analysis to consider both criteria in the sense of earthquake risk-sensitive planning. Then, overall earthquake risk map obtained which could be used as an input for disaster mitigation processes.

The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by citizens after a disaster increases resilience against disasters. In this context, this paper's research question is "How to build disaster resilience via sustainable development?". Therefore, the aim of this study is to increase pre and post disaster resilience by using ICTs to ensure citizens play an active role in disaster management. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J	Iizuka, S				Iizuka, Satoru			Future environmental assessment and urban planning by downscaling simulations	JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS			English	Article						Future projection; Downscaling simulation; Environmental assessment; Urban planning	GENERATION; MODELS	The outline of a sophisticated downscaling simulation model developed by the author and colleagues and its application for projecting the future urban thermal environment during the progress of global warming are introduced in this paper. Examples of inevitable uncertainties in future projections brought by the choices of a greenhouse gas emissions scenario and general circulation model (GCM) data are also shown. Moreover, three examples of the environmental assessment for future urban planning, i.e., (1) disaster mitigation and prevention urban structure scenario, (2) compact city scenario, and (3) city master plan in a developing country, by the developed downscaling simulation model are presented. Downscaling simulation is a very powerful environmental assessment tool and is very useful for urban planning, especially in the inevitable future global warming period.

In china, ancient people tried to locate their housing within good environment and make an overall urban plan and establish a perfect urban system. They considered that this system can provide a harmonious spatial relationship between human settlements and natural environment, prevent disaster, and guarantee the owner's bright future. In this paper, we discuss the Chinese traditional culture in urban planning. It is necessary to succeed the traditional culture and build a new urban planning theory for urban sustainable development.

J	Montoya, L; Masser, I				Montoya, L; Masser, I			Management of natural hazard risk in Cartago, Costa Rica	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						natural hazards; disaster management; urban planning; planning-support systems; Cartago; Costa Rica; geographic information		Cities are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters due to the concentration of population, buildings and infrastructure. With urbanisation on the rise, particularly in developing countries, the incorporation of disaster management is high on urban agendas as the losses from a single event can destroy decades of development. The main challenge at the moment is to move forward from general policy manifestos to effective networking and case-specific urban disaster mitigation plans. This paper presents the main findings of a research project that aimed at first identifying gaps in current urban planning framework and practices as well developing geographically referenced information products to aid the process of selection of adequate disaster mitigation strategies. The Costa Rican city of Cartago was used as case study since it constitutes a good example of a municipality in a developing country with serious natural hazard threats and where urban plans have been drawn up with deficient or even absent information on potential natural hazards' losses.

J	Echendu, AJ				Echendu, Adaku Jane			Relationship between urban planning and flooding in Port Harcourt city, Nigeria; insights from planning professionals	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						disaster management; flooding; Nigeria; pluvial flooding; urban planning; urban resilience; urbanisation		Flooding is widely recognised as a global problem which has worsened in recent years due to climate change. In Nigeria, flooding remains the most widespread environmental disaster with the population of 200 million suffering numerous threats from perennial flooding. Port Harcourt in Southern Nigeria experiences annual flooding on a significant scale. While research has linked the flooding in Port Harcourt to poor urban planning, little research has engaged with planning professionals to investigate this relationship. This paper fills this gap. It explores how urban planning is linked to flooding in Port Harcourt and reports on qualitative research undertaken with five urban planners in Port Harcourt. The findings affirm that poor planning and/or lack of compliance with planning regulations are the main factors contributing to the flooding of Port Harcourt. The urban planners gave their expert opinions on how to control the flooding and unanimously agreed that improved planning practices could control the endemic flooding problem in the city. This implies that the government needs to work more closely with urban planners and other stakeholders to effectively control and find a lasting solution to the flooding problem in Port Harcourt city.

J	Chan, SL; Wey, WM; Chang, PH				Chan, Shin-Liang; Wey, Wann-Ming; Chang, Pin-Huai			Establishing Disaster Resilience Indicators for Tan-sui River Basin in Taiwan	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						Resilience indicator; Tan-sui river basin; Taiwan; Fuzzy Delphi; Analytic network process	ANALYTIC NETWORK PROCESS; FUZZY DELPHI METHOD; SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS; PROCESS MODEL; PROJECT; SYSTEMS; COMMUNITY; SET; VULNERABILITY; METHODOLOGY	A major trend in disaster management is to build resilience for sustainable development. Resilience is defined as the ability which may be learned from previous disaster experiences to make the system more stable than before through absorbing and adapting the changes caused by the disaster. In this paper, enhancing disaster resilience in a river basin is studied and regarded as an important operation process to achieve sustainability of urban area. The measurement of disaster resilience can be used as a potential environmental disaster diagnosis of previous urban planning policy strategies, and is a required foundation for drafting future spatial and urban planning policies. This paper proposes an application that combines fuzzy Delphi and analytic network process techniques in order to establish a set of disaster resilience indicators for a re-developed urban area in Tan-sui River Basin (Taiwan). By incorporating expert opinion, a priority index is calculated for each studied disaster resilience indicator. And, an enhanced resilience indicator evaluation methodology, which reflects interdependencies among evaluation dimensions using an integrated approach, is suggested in this paper. The results show that the main influences on satisfaction are: (1) factors of the management institute of basin, (2) financial capability, (3) conservation of water resource, (4) environmentally sensitive area, and (5) conservation of slope area. Overall, these main influences (five resilience indicators) show future directions for sustainable development in Tan-sui River Basin.

J	Cinar, AK; Akgun, Y; Maral, H				Cinar, Ali Kemal; Akgun, Yenal; Maral, Huseyin			Analyzing The Planning Criteria for Emergency Assembly Points and Temporary Shelter Areas: Case of Izmir-Karsiyaka	PLANLAMA-PLANNING			Turkish	Article						Disaster response planning; emergency assembly points and temporary shelter areas; disaster management	EVACUATION; LOCATION	Determining the appropriate number and distribution of emergency assembly points and temporary shelter areas to be used following a disaster, as well as their technical requirements and capacity to provide services is one of the most significant concerns of urban planning and disaster management. Disaster management studies were first implemented in Izmir in 1999 with the RADIUS (Risk Assessment tools for Diagnosis of Urban areas against Seismic Disasters) Project and were advanced with the Izmir Provincial Emergency Assistance Plan issued by the governorship in 2006. Emergency assembly points and temporary shelter areas were allocated in this plan. In addition, the Izmir Disaster Response Plan (IZAMP) and Turkey's National Disaster Response Plan-Izmir (TAMP) were recently prepared by the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD). According to IZAMP and TAMP, emergency assembly points have been determined, but temporary shelter areas have not yet been decided upon and published for all districts. In this study, earlier research studies that studied assembly points and temporary shelter areas in Izmir were examined. As a case study, the location and attributes of previously designated emergency assembly points in the Karsiyaka district and their consistency with national and international standards were analyzed. Striking examples at the neighborhood level indicate that emergency assembly points have been made unusable due to ownership and development plan changes, construction, and lack of coordination between institutions. Political, subjective, and incremental decisions made by central and/or local governments in the absence of disaster and emergency management and urban planning activities lead to increased disaster risk despite all of the existing scientific and strategic work on disaster preparation and recovery.

J	Orhan, E				Orhan, Ezgi			READING VULNERABILITIES THROUGH URBAN PLANNING HISTORY: AN EARTHQUAKE-PRONE CITY, ADAPAZARI CASE FROM TURKEY	METU JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						Urban vulnerability; planning history; urban spatial structure; 1999 Earthquake; Adapazari		Agglomeration of urban population, inadequate institutional capacity, unplanned urbanization, dense built environment, and industrial concentration are considered as the main causes of urban vulnerabilities against encountered disturbances. Planning decisions which regulate these factors are expected to make contribution to safer urban and social contexts and resilience of cities. However, in developing countries such as Turkey where disaster management is not an integrated part of urban planning process, planning decisions may serve for the construction of vulnerabilities. This study reads urban vulnerabilities with respect to urban structuring led by planning decisions. In doing so, an earthquake-prone city, Adapazari was selected to investigate urban vulnerability according to different planning periods and disaster history. The outcome of this study is that planning decisions disregarding urban risks may not contribute to the creation of a safer spatial and social context with respect to disaster mitigation, rather serve to reproduction of urban vulnerabilities.

The cost of rapid and haphazard urbanization: lessons learned from the Freetown landslide disaster	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Rapid urbanization; Haphazard urban planning; Geo-hazards; Disaster; Land-use change	RISK-ASSESSMENT; LAND-USE; FLOOD; VULNERABILITY; GROWTH	Urbanization has been linked to destructive geo-hazards that can cause loss of life, destruction of property, and environmental damage. On August 14, 2017, a devastating geo-hazard chaina debris slide, debris flow, and sediment-laden floodin Freetown, Sierra Leone resulted in at least 500 deaths and over 600 missing persons and the destruction of hundreds of houses. This study uses 10years of high-resolution satellite images to conduct a remote sensing analysis of the disaster. Although rainfall was the trigger, rapid and haphazard urbanization acted to increase both hazard and vulnerability. Specifically, poor urban planning with inadequate consideration of risk led to housing construction in dangerous areas; clearance of hillside vegetation increased erosion potential; very low cost buildings using frail construction material and methods lacked resilience; and insufficient risk management led to weak emergency response.

These later develop into major vulnerabilities that can cause immense devastation in the event of a disaster. Therefore, as a city develops, it is essential to monitor its growth in order to 1) guide its development to avoid accumulating further risks and 2) enable the urban system to cope with the risks that already exist. This paper focuses on dealing with existing risks and the potential to address disaster-risk response within the existing fire-fighting framework. It identifies GIS-based spatialanalysis methods that can assist in determining the urban system's capacity to accommodate the necessary service functions during both regular emergencies and disaster situations. As an example, response-capacity analysis for firefighting services in Yangon City is carried out to identify the inadequacies of the current system. These are then matched with the potentialfire- risk map to consider the demand increase for fire stations in disaster situations due to the likelihood of multiple ignitions. Areas where infrastructural and logistical improvements should be prioritized are discussed, and urban planning measures to help develop a safe and resilient city are considered within the developing-country context.

J	Wang, JG				Wang, Jianguo			Vision of China's future urban construction reform: In the perspective of comprehensive prevention and control for multi disasters	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						COVID-19; Multi disasters; Prevention and control; Multiple objectives' optimization; Urban planning and design; Regulations reform	WATER; CONTAMINANT; ENVIRONMENT; EPIDEMIC; LESSONS; MODELS; HEALTH; IMPACT	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge deaths, massive damage and losses around the world. Looking back in history, the motivation for construction and development of cities was to enhance disaster prevention capacity, while modern cities are built and developed to improve health and wellness for human beings. Each disaster would pose some new challenges to the urban planning and architectural design, such as COVID-19. Therefore, the dilemma of future multi disasters (e.g. epidemics) would lead to reflections on the revision or change of urban design regulations. For the post-epidemic era, a comprehensive and integrated prevention system should be established for multi urban disasters, which requires to be optimally formulated based on multiple objectives, i.e., on the balancing of disaster occurrence probability and stop loss cost. This will be realized thanks to the rapid development of digital alike advanced technologies. Thus, this paper aims to provide a reference for the prevention and control of future city epidemics and disasters in responding to strategies of urban planning and design by considering the reform of urban construction related regulations, further to facilitate the creation of healthy and safe urban environments.

Therefore, it is essential that we tighten our control on each level and break the chain of disaster through disaster monitoring technology, risk assessment technology and emergency rescue technology. And the whole work should be based on the theory of chain-cutting disaster mitigation and the technology of 3S digital information. We should emphasize on the function of disaster prevention when we plan Binhai Industrial Park and design the industrial buildings, improve the technique of comprehensive disaster prevention within the framework of urban planning. With the adoption of certain counter-disaster strategies (the strategies should be related to the natural causing factors of the industrial disaster, such as storm tide), we will achieve our goal of building a disaster-free industrial park.

J	Ozerdem, A; Barakat, S				Ozerdem, A; Barakat, S			After the Marmara earthquake: lessons for avoiding short cuts to disasters	THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY			English	Article								This paper aims to explore a number of lessons learned from the disaster management experience in Turkey in response to the Marmara earthquake in August 1999. It discusses the shortcomings of disaster mitigation and preparedness measures in Turkey in the context of a disaster and development relationship, including a number of issues such as legislation and training, public awareness, insurance, urban planning and management, and disaster response strategies. It explains why this earthquake produced such a large impact and suggests why, unlike previous earthquakes, the public reaction to the shortcomings in disaster mitigation and preparedness for the earthquake may promote important changes within Turkish society. Through the investigation of disaster management practice irt the light of lessons learned from the Marmara earthquake experience, the paper outlines possible responses to these shortcomings.

J	Bhanjee, S; Zhang, SM				Bhanjee, Sheliza; Zhang, Sumei			Do urban planning and sprawl affect social vulnerability? An assessment of Dar es Salaam	DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article						Urban planning; Dar es Salaam; land use; social vulnerability; informal; sprawl	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; ADAPTATION; CITY; SETTLEMENTS; POPULATION; RESILIENCE; DYNAMICS; POVERTY; GROWTH	This study explores connections between urban planning, sprawl, and social vulnerability factors in the Sub-Saharan context with the aim to investigate the influence of broader planning and land use aspects in quantitative urban social vulnerability assessment. Dar es Salaam, Tanzania serves as the study area because of its substantial informal development, sprawling, and availability of reliable datasets for recent years. Two main research questions are proposed: does urban planning reduce social vulnerability (measured by quality of life and mobility) and does urban sprawl contribute to social vulnerability in this city? Results indicate formally planned urban areas are associated with higher levels of quality of life and mobility. Further results indicate no significant impact of sprawl on social vulnerability factors of residents in the general urban areas of Dar es Salaam, however, informal sprawl is linked to higher social vulnerability.

The purpose of the study is to analyse the L'Aquila urban planning experiences in order to trace the relationship between the mobility and the spatial structure of the city. The current scenario is considered both as the result of the historical evolution of the settlement and as a dynamic system in which a mix of natural forces, decisional choices and technical expertise have operated. The result of the research is a preliminary proposal for the implementation of the public transportation system that is obtained by integrating a re-designed existing railway line with a sustainable concepts of mobility based on a "dense grid" network.

In each hazard, we investigated and analyzed actual situations through field survey and interviews to victims. We identified the problems of existing systems in the GEJE case, especially problems in urban planning for high-risk areas. We also found problems in relation to inviting foreign companies by special deregulation policy to areas that were revealed as having high flood-risk at the wake of the Thai flood, as well as serious damage induced by worldwide concatenation in the supply chains of various industries. Through these reviews, we points out lessons to be learned from two unprecedented disaster occurred in 2011. We also described lessons learned and recommend countermeasures for mega disasters, discussing what measures are required to build a disaster-resilient society in thefuture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - This research was conducted using a heuristic approach to the examination of urban planning and DRR practices focussing particularly upon citizens' participation in four case studies internationally: the UK floods in 2007; Hurricane Katrina in the USA in 2005; wildfires of 2009 in Victoria, Australia; and Swiss avalanche prevention and preparedness. Desktop research was conducted to analyse cases and identify key findings, confirmed and augmented by interviews with relevant specialists in each country through semi-structured interviews. Findings - The research reveals some similarities across all four cases studied. It appears that urban planning and DRR approaches, particularly those with a regulatory outcome and based on highly technical tests, are common. Further, it is apparent in the cases studied that circumstances where deeper technical knowledge and/or self-interest are strong factors, that informing and sometimes consulting styles are the most appropriate. While the scope of the paper means that this principle cannot be widely applied, there is a need to investigate these issues further. Research limitations/implications - The heuristic and inductive nature of this research limits the potential for in-depth analyses of the case studies, but rather provides a base for future research in this area, which currently has limited literature. Originality/value - This study provides a wide base for future research and partially addresses the gap in the literature on the topic of integration of urban planning and DRR with a focus on the community involvement in it.

Big and open data offer considerable potential for analyzing and predicting human mobility during disaster events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to better disaster risk reduction (DRR) planning. However, the value of human mobility data and analysis (HMDA) in urban resilience research is poorly understood. This review highlights key opportunities for and challenges hindering the use of HMDA in DRR in urban planning and risk science, as well as insights from practitioners. A gap in research on HMDA for data-driven DRR planning was identified. By examining human mobility studies and their respective analytical and planning tools, this paper offers deeper insights into the challenges that must be addressed to improve the development of effective data-driven DRR planning, from data collection to implementation. In future work on HMDA, (i) the human mobility of vulnerable populations should be targeted, (ii) research should focus on disaster mitigation and prevention, (iii) analytical methods for evidence-based disaster planning should be developed, (iv) different types of data should be integrated into analyses to overcome methodological challenges, and (v) a decision-making framework should be developed for evidence-based urban planning through transdisciplinary knowledge co-production.

Dense residential areas suffered serious damage particularly; Houses, fences and utility poles collapsed and street networks were closed. Emergency traffic could not arrive at their destinations from outside of the areas. The urban planning for disaster prevention in a dense residential area becomes an important issue in Eastern Asia countries. This paper presents an urban planning support system in a dense residential area to make a plan or prevention of disasters caused by street blockades. This system supports a planning process to make a consensus and a policy through a heuristic process from the viewpoint of assuring arrival for each building. In the case study, calculation results of the spatial distribution and the amount of inaccessible buildings are shown under some given conditions. Also the effect of fence improvements is shown and discussed.

Disaster intervention calls for responsible preparation that must be managed from the top down and from the bottom up. Based on ecologic systems theory and principles borrowed from public health, preventive medicine, communal welfare, education and urban planning, this article offers a theory of disaster that proposes a common intellectual matrix for medical, psychological, educational, and social interventions.

J	Tag-Eldeen, ZN				Tag-Eldeen, Zeinab Noureddine			Bridging urban planning knowledge into post-disaster response: Early Recovery Road Map within the International Humanitarian Cluster System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Early recovery; Urban disaster; Global Cluster for Early Recover; Planning knowledge; New role of planners	DISASTER	Given the scale and the complexity of urban disaster, significant efforts have been intensified by the International Humanitarian Community over the last decade to develop an effective operational mechanism in post-disaster and conflict response, to create synergies between short-term relief measures and long-term development, and to maximize the efficient use of limited resources. In spite of the positive impact of these efforts on humanitarian response, the historical separation between relief, recovery and development continues with significant practical implications on the effectiveness of humanitarian response programs, especially in urban disasters. This paper explores the viability of employing well-established planning knowledge to provide systematic ways to integrate the sectoral response activities, especially in complex urban settings, that help link the humanitarian response with recovery and development. A conceptual and operational framework named Early Recovery Road Map (ERRoMap) using urban planning knowledge is suggested as a new dimension to be added to the traditional role of the Global Cluster for Early Recovery (GCER) in the International Humanitarian Cluster System. The ERRoMap employs the three conceptualized terms of planning efforts: process, context, and outcome to re-organize the function of a 'City' under time-pressure. The process of making an ERRoMap is aimed to bridge the emergency response with recovery through organizing facts about disaster impacts in urban settings; identify essential areas for early recovery, join-up efforts of humanitarian actors and facilitate their communications with development actors.

J	Jayakody, RRJC; Amaratunga, D				Jayakody, R. R. J. Chathuranganee; Amaratunga, Dilanthi			Guiding factors for planning public open spaces to enhance coastal cities' disaster resilience to tsunamis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban planning; Sustainable development; Built environment; Disaster resilience; Tsunami; Public open spaces; Coastal cities		Purpose Public open spaces (POS) in cities are often measured as a strength to enhance cities' sustainability with a contribution to the three pillars: economic, social and environmental. Nevertheless, the importance of POS for disaster resilience is less recognised and remains under-rehearsed in the urban planning context. Within this context, this research paper aims to investigate the methods and approaches of using POS to enhance the coastal cities' resilience to tsunamis through planning and designing interventions. Design/methodology/approach This study used the grounded theory as the research strategy. Accordingly, data collection involved 72 unstructured interviews covering a wide variety of participants related to the field of study including tsunami-affected communities, disaster resilience experts, urban planners, sociologists and coastal planners, in the context of Sri Lanka. The grounded theory coding procedure is used to analyse the data that includes transcripts, notes, maps and documents. Findings The analysis reveals that there is a significant potential to use POS to enhance the coastal cities' resilience to tsunamis as an emergency evacuation directing point, as a primary place for emergency rescue, as an agent for temporary sheltering, as a facilitator for tsunami disaster mitigation and as a mediator to provide tsunami awareness. Finally, the findings propose five guiding factors for planning POS to enhance coastal cities' disaster resilience to Tsunamis. Originality/value This paper introduces an innovative and unique approach for future urban planners and design professionals, to plan and design POS with a new direction towards disaster resilience while ensuring sustainability.

J	Vicuna, M; Leon, J; Guzman, S				Vicuna, Magdalena; Leon, Jorge; Guzman, Simon			Urban form planning and tsunami risk vulnerability: Analysis of 12 Chilean coastal cities	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Urban planning; urban form; tsunami risk; coastal cities	OPEN SPACE; DISASTER; EVACUATION; RESILIENCE; EARTHQUAKE; IQUIQUE	Urban form has a significant impact on risk. Spatial planning instruments can optimize urban form in areas exposed to hazards. This work discusses how urban planning instruments, specifically Communal Regulatory Plans (CRPs), affect vulnerability to the risk of tsunami inundation in Chilean coastal cities. We analyze urban form and address exposure, susceptibility, and response capacity parameters. Exposure is evaluated by comparing existing and planned densities and to what extent planned risk areas coincide with inundation zones. We analyze existing critical facilities and land uses permitted by the CRP in inundation zones to evaluate susceptibility. We explore response capacity through the street network connectivity and green areas outside the inundation zone and how CRPs influence the structuring of new roads and new green spaces. We found that CRPs do not hold the sufficient capacity to incorporate and manage the tsunami inundation risk adequately. The planning scenario leads to a systematic increase in vulnerability as cities develop in exposed areas. We suggest to strengthen CRPs capacities to prevent the construction and reconstruction of areas affected by tsunamis, reinforcing the urban fabric's potential for evacuation, and to strengthen joint work between municipal urban planning and disaster risk management departments, among other recommendations.

Analysis and assessment of vulnerability provide a new basis for urban planning. This study constructed a quantitative index system for assessing vulnerability, based on the city's sensitivity and emergency response capacity. City size, density, and spatial form influence a city's sensitivity to crises and risks, to which vulnerability is positively related. Levels of socio-economic development, infrastructures, and emergency management contribute to a city's emergency response capacity, with which vulnerability is inversely associated. Vulnerability of 19 large Chinese cities was assessed. Harbin and Shenzhen demonstrated the highest and lowest vulnerability among 19 cities, while Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou ranked the 5th, the 9th and the 12th. Spatially, northern cities tended to be more vulnerable than southern cities. And the differences in vulnerability among cities were explored based on cities' physical geography conditions, level of socio-economic development, infrastructures, regional status, history of disaster, history of urban planning and development, government policies, etc.	[Xiu Chunliang; Cheng Lin; Wu Wei] NE Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Song Wei] Univ Louisville, Dept Geog & Geosci, Louisville, KY 40292 USA		Xiu, CL (autor correspondente), NE Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.	xiucl@nenu.edu.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of China [40635030]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	Foundation item: Under the auspices of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 40635030)	[Anonymous], 2001, CLIMATE CHANGE 2001; [Anonymous], 2002, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0195-9255(02)00012-4; Cutter SL, 2003, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V93, P1, DOI 10.1111/1467-8306.93101; Cutter SL, 2000, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V90, P713, DOI 10.1111/0004-5608.00219; Downing T.E., 2000, IHDP NEWSLETTER UPDA; IHDP, 2001, IHDP UPD UPD ISS 3 0; Janssen MA, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P240, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.04.001; Kasperson J.

Disaster risk assessment tends to develop towards the direction of refinement and it gradually plays a more important role. According to the characteristics of storm surge disaster in coastal plain, the paper uses refined floodplain numerical model which combines typhoon, flood, astronomical tide and waves to simulate inundation process. The model also considers influencing factors of dike-breaking, micro-topography and buildings. Precise calculation is executed for the range and the submerged depth caused by floodplain flow in coastal plain. Based on 3S technology, disaster-bearing bodies are subdivided into the smallest unit of the ground object, and the vulnerability of these units is evaluated. Refined risk assessment of storm surge disaster for the coastal plain is obtained, and the detailed distribution of risk areas at different risk levels is achieved. These results can be widely applied in many fields, such as disaster prevention and mitigation, urban planning, industrial arrangement, disaster insurance and so on.

J	Dreier, P				Dreier, P			Katrina and power in America	URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW			English	Article						urban policy; urban planning; disaster; federalism; class conflict; racism		The Katrina disaster exposed the major fault lines of American society and politics: class and race. It offers lessons for urban scholars and practitioners. Katrina was a human-made disaster more than a natural disaster. The conditions that led to the disaster, and the response by government officials, were the result of policy choices. Government incompetence was an outgrowth of a more serious indifference to the plight of cities and the poor. As a result, the opportunity to reconstruct New Orleans as part of a bold regional renewal plan was lost. Whatever positive things happen in Katrina's aftermath will be due, in large measure, to the long-term work of grassroots community and union-organizing groups who mobilized quickly to provide a voice for the have-nots and who found allies among professionals to help formulate alternative plans to those developed by business and political elites.

The circulation, of anthropologically, threatening images of violence, terror, covert infection and social suffering has intensified in our public culture. Examining perceptual systems of global risk, this essay asks: what is the visual structure of the historical catastrophe as mediatic event? How do visual Cultures and technologies of risk and threat perception stratify sensor), experience?

Some factors, such as anti-disaster ability and regional feature, have not been considered in existing researches. Considering these two factors, a novel comprehensive assessment method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, combining existing researches, anti-disaster ability is introduced in the index system which includes security, reliability, economy, flexibility, cooperativeness and anti-disaster ability; Secondly, based on analytic hierarchy process, the impacts of regional economy, disaster distribution and geography on the weights of each index are analyzed, proposing a comprehensive assessment method considering regional feathers; Finally, a twelfth five-year planning scheme in a city is taken as a case to analyze the practicability and effectiveness.

J	Saavedra, J; de la Cruz, GA; Fernandez-Vicente, P				Saavedra, Juan; de la Cruz, Gabriela Azocar; Fernandez-Vicente, Patricia			Neoliberalism of disaster and long-term recovery: The case of the 2010 earthquake in Talcahuano, Chile	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Long-term recover; Neoliberalism; Community; Emergency government; Urban design	RESILIENCE; RECONSTRUCTION	In this article, it was analyzed the long-term disaster recovery after the earthquake and tsunami that affected Talcahuano, Chile in February 2010. Under the assumption that disaster governance is neither politically nor discursively neuter, the aim of this article is to describe the long-term recovery process of Talcahuano, where urban planning was adjusted to the political neoliberal frame. We used a unique-case study. There were considered 7 maps that show longitudinally the changes in Talcahuano's city design. There are maps about tsunami risk zones and landslide risk zones. Additionally, there were used 25 interviews to complement the recovery process. The results show that Talcahuano experienced post disaster changes in urban planning in line with neoliberal politics. The changes can be seen in the enlargement of commercial and residential zones. In some cases, the new building zones overlap in potentially risky zones of coastline and hills. The conclusions of the study show there is a recovery in terms of rebuilding and the organization of its local governance in emergency responses. Nevertheless, it was not able to avoid the general frame given by neoliberal regime. For more than a decade, the post-disaster recovery process favors the market growth and partially omit the local community participation in decision-making about the city design. The study case about 2010 earthquake in Talcahuano, Chile, contributes to observe long-term recovery as complex processes where the political regime aspects should be included in the analysis.

The building of earthquake evacuation shelters is an effective way to reduce earthquake disaster risk and protect lives. Current studies on facility location models commonly overlook multiple optimal criteria from an urban planning perspective and are not suited to planning earthquake evacuation shelters. In this study, we describe seven principles for locating earthquake evacuation shelters. Following these principles, we propose a multi-criteria constraint location model that can be used to solve the location problem. We then present an iterative method to solve the model. With the support of a geographic information system (GIS), the method is composed of three steps: select candidate shelters, analyze the spatial coverage of candidate shelters and determine the shelter locations. Finally, a case study is used to demonstrate the application of the multi-criteria model and the corresponding solution method for its effectiveness in planning urban earthquake evacuation shelters. We conclude that the evacuation shelter location model and solution method are effective and suitable to solve the multi-criteria shelter location problem from an urban planning perspective.

J	Oteng-Ababio, M				Oteng-Ababio, Martin			Was "Black Wednesday' avoidable? The Melcom disaster in Accra puts a generation on trial	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Melcom disaster; anthropogenic hazards; disaster risk preparedness; sustainable development; Accra	MARKET	This study contributes to the existing literature on disaster risk preparedness in sub-Saharan African cities. The paper demonstrates how corruption and personal greed condemn society to the mercy of disaster events, by examining stakeholders perspectives on the causal factors of the collapse of a Melcom shopping centre in Accra and by situating the event within the broader context of disaster management. A high concentration of people and physical and financial assets in cities means that a single accident can cause catastrophic effects and destroy years of development gains. The paper shows how increasing urbanization is shaping where and when disaster strikes and whom it affects most. It further emphasizes the need for disaster risk reduction practitioners to communicate with urban planning professionals in the planning and implementation of development projects. Significantly, the evidence suggests that the government has failed to incorporate lessons gleaned from past disasters into policies to avert future disasters. The paper concludes that a deeper understanding of the root causes of past events and a sustained focus on risk reduction and disaster preparedness are crucial to mitigating the impact of hazards and building resilient cities.

It is also used in industries for locating and zoning the hazardous areas inside the premises as per the level of hazards. Hazard maps are used mainly for land management, hazard identification, geological surveys for insurance rate adjustments and hazard mitigation. In concern with its industrial and urban planning, hazard mapping is done by all the authority and workers to identify hazard at a particular place, and thus, they learn to develop maps for every hazardous location for identifying and mitigating potential hazards with special emphasis on economic and social parameter. This work is perhaps an attempt to catalogue all the hazardous map systems and techniques for developing hazardous maps associated with sustainable urban planning and industrial development, and suggestions to use hazardous maps for sustainable development have also been touched upon.

J	Gonzalez, SG				Gonzalez, Silvia G.			Hydric risk and urban planning in the city of Buenos Aires	ESTUDIOS DEL HABITAT			Spanish	Article						Hydric risk; Urban planning; Risk management; Flood-prone areas		This paper explores flood risk management in the City of Buenos Aires during the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, a period in which a series of hydraulic plans have been designed, all aimed at giving a "solution" to the overflows of the portends channeled streams. The link between risk management and urban planning is discussed, considering, on the one hand, the different paradigms in which the latest has been inserted (hygienist, rational, etc.) and on the other hand, the conception of the floodplain as socio-spatial, historical product, fruit of actions and decisions of key social actors with logics and interests in tension. This synthetic historical journey recognizes stages marked by different views on flood-prone areas. In each one of them it is possible to identify specific characteristics and rationalities that persist in the relationship between flooding, proposal of mitigation and urban planning: appropriation and reappropriation of flood-prone areas, denial and rediscovery of risk. The conclusion aims to contribute to the effective integration between risk management and urban policy, from the perspective of flood risk as a historical social construction and as an anticipation of the disaster.

A triad that built territories at risk	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Development studies; Urban governance; Risk governance; Risk perception; Spatial planning	RESILIENCE; TSUNAMI; GOVERNANCE; URBANIZATION; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; CONCEPCION; COUNTRIES	Chilean geography exposes the country to high-level risks such as earthquakes and tsunamis. The disasters of 1930, 1960, 2010, and 2014 testify to the continuous link between human survival and disasters. However, new hazards have appeared ever since -i.e. flood waterlogging, wildfires, and landslides-, highlighting the relationship between current land uses and space occupation with increasing levels of disaster risk. This research aims to determine relations and responsibilities of the Chilean developmental approach in urban planning and territorial governance processes that have created new territories prone to disaster risk. We resort to a longitudinal analysis from 1930 to 2018 at the Gran Concepcion metropolitan area as a proxy of Chilean industrialization and economic development approaches. To do so, we developed mixed-approach descriptive research, for which we collected data from national development policies and documented land occupation processes during pre-dictatorship, dictatorship and post-dictatorship periods. Semi-structured interviews with decision-makers involved in current territorial policy were also carried out. The findings show how territorial governance resulted from political visions around different development paths, wherein the concept of risk is weakly perceived among decision-makers. This perception is linked to narrow economic goals and the understanding of land as a barely regulated marketable asset, profoundly affected by segregated urban planning.

J	Aoki, N				Aoki, Naomi			Sequencing and combining participation in urban planning: The case of tsunami-ravaged Onagawa Town, Japan	CITIES			English	Article						Participatory governance; Disaster governance; Urban planning; Reconstruction; Shrinking society; Community assets	CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; NATURAL DISASTER; GOVERNANCE; EARTHQUAKE; COUNTRIES; LADDER	Onagawa, a remote rural town in Japan, is on the verge of crisis: its population is aging and shrinking, and this adversity has been even more pronounced since the town was ravaged by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and resulting tsunami. In its struggle to survive and revive, the town has emerged as a gem of participatory governance by instituting a multitude of participatory mechanisms with renewed leadership. This development shows how disasters induced by natural hazards can be a catalyst for progressive democratic change in a rural town like Onagawa, in contrast with earlier findings that disasters adversely affect democratic institutions and values. Onagawa's case also draws scholarly and policy attention to how to sequence and combine different participatory mechanisms in urban planning. Informed by field work, the study modifies an existing theoretical model to systematically highlight Onagawa's participatory mechanisms during the reconstruction planning, including their differences and complementarities. This institutional plurality served multiple purposes, including (i) allowing lay stakeholders to brainstorm a general reconstruction plan, (ii) avoiding the conflation of technical and lay discussions, (iii) reaching out to evacuees who were not able to participate, and (iv) educating citizens on town planning in hopes of nourishing a participatory culture in the long run.

Yet, nine years after the 1999 Marmara earthquake in Turkey, the redevelopment of risky housing areas is still a point of debate on the urban planning and disaster mitigation agenda. However, planning studies on mildly and moderately damaged areas located in the centre of Istanbul are ongoing. This article presents the evidence of a pilot project undertaken by Zeytinburnu Municipality, Istanbul, four years after the Marmara earthquake.(2) The aim is to generate a debate on the preconditions required for a sustainable urban regeneration approach in the post-disaster recovery phase. The results of the pilot project underline the importance of capacity building in sustaining social capital, strengthening the legal framework, restructuring planning regulations, and managing the housing redevelopment process by taking advantage of a window of opportunity afforded by the disaster recovery period.

This paper examines recovery in four disaster-impacted communities. In the two Australian examples rural communities were impacted by the 2011 Queensland floods. The two Japanese communities discussed suffered in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and, in one case, from radiation contamination arising from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. We argue that local sociality is often poorly understood by external parties such as disaster recovery experts and agencies. The Japanese planning concept of machizukuri - literally "creating communities" - incorporates physical, structural and social aspects in urban planning practices and was successfully applied to recovery processes in one of the Japanese cases. Drawing on that case, the paper concludes that machizukuri offers a valuable tool to foster better consideration of local sociality - both pre- and post-disaster - as an intrinsic component of communities' vulnerability and resilience.

Research is reported on the development of a knowledge database and decision support framework to enable more effective disaster risk-management strategies from a construction perspective. A survey of UK professionals involved with disaster risk-management activities (i.e. emergency planning, constructing, urban planning, insurance) indicates that knowledge and awareness of integrated approaches is poor, and the construction sector as a key stakeholder and potential resource is not being used sufficiently. Key recommendations to improve the construction sector in the process are as follows: construction-related stakeholders need to become more involved in groups such as Local Resilience Teams and Forums; risk and hazard awareness training needs to be integrated systematically into the professional training of architects, planners, engineers, developers, etc.; and the construction sector should embrace and pre-empt regulatory changes regarding resilient construction requirements.

Flood risk is calculated as a function of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The flood risk for a building was classified into five classes, and the distribution characteristics of buildings were examined according to England's flood risk vulnerability classification system, known as Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25). After analyzing the risk of flooding in Ulsan Metropolitan City, one of Korea's representative urban areas, it was found that while Dong-gu District can be considered relatively safe, districts of Jung-gu and Nam-gu, as well as Ulju-gun, have highly vulnerable buildings with red and orange ratings, which include motor vehicles-related facilities, education and welfare facilities, and residential facilities. There has been evidence to prove that urban flood disaster affects topography and the environment, in addition to having a significant effect on adaptability depending on the facility groups that resulted from urbanization. This study is expected to serve as a scientific database for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to floods during land-use planning, which would eventually allow for systematic management of high-risk buildings through verification of location suitability of buildings by facility group.

As densely populated and resource-intensive regions, cities will experience the enhanced heat island effect, flooding or water scarcity as a result of extremes in rainfall, and severe storms may devastate entire settlements. In the face of a projected rise in the frequency and severity of nature disasters due to socio-economic developments and climate change the question arises of how to adapt to and ameliorate impacts of natural disasters. This paper provides some insights into this subject from an urban planning perspective and takes a review on the aspects of climate change impacts on urban economics, based on the practices of mitigation and adaptation experiences, some strategies of adaptation are provided and discussed at last.

J	Tatebe, J; Mutch, C				Tatebe, Jennifer; Mutch, Carol			Perspectives on education, children and young people in disaster risk reduction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Review						Disaster risk reduction; Disaster education; Schools; Children and young people		This article presents a synthesis of education focused disaster risk reduction (DRR) literature. Our aim was to understand the landscape of DRR with a focus on education, schools, children and young people. A review of 40 international reports and peer-reviewed academic journal articles published between 2003 and 2014 across a range of disciplines health, urban planning, public policy, and emergency management, and a range of intergovernmental, international aid and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) examine various aspects of education related DRR activities. The corresponding analysis identifies common themes across the multi-disciplinary literature as well as several gaps in research about education's role in DRR highlighting the complexity of DRR research, which reflects the multiplicity of purposes, audiences, and social and political perspectives they represent. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, problems in connection with people are not taken seriously. Regardless of disaster type, human beings, as one group of the disaster receptors, produce a similar psychological and physiological response to threats. Therefore, disaster prevention and mitigation should be people-oriented. Based on danger stress response, this paper analyses types and characteristics of thinking and behavior in disasters or emergencies and reflects the significance of people-oriented urban safety design. In addition, this paper takes public space, which plays an important role in urban security as the main subject and proposes urban design strategies on appeasing negative psychological and behavioral stress response, attempts to provide a scientific basis for effective disaster prevention strategies in order to minimize the hazards to humans caused by physical and psychological impact.

J	Smith, D				Smith, David			The relational attributes of marketplaces in post-earthquake Port-au-Prince, Haiti	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION			English	Article						customers; earthquake; food security; Haiti; hazards; infrastructure; marketplaces; traders; urban		This paper explores the interplay between social and physical aspects of food retail in disaster and post-disaster contexts and discusses how it can inform better market support interventions and food retail modernization agendas. To this end, this paper draws on a case study analysis of three distinct marketplaces in metropolitan Port-au-Prince to explore aspects of food provision and access. The findings demonstrate the pertinence of beneficial reciprocal relationships among traders and between traders and customers, as well as the physical preconditions for the existence and maintenance of these relationships over time. The study also reviews the impacts of destroyed and changing physical infrastructure in disaster and post-disaster contexts on these social relationships. It concludes by calling for an acknowledgement of the interrelated attributes of solidarity, proximity and stability of existing marketplaces in urban planning and humanitarian practices in the efforts to improve urban food security and disaster recovery.

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as tracking and mapping, geospatial analysis, remote sensing techniques, robotics, drone technology, machine learning, telecom and network services, accident and hot spot analysis, smart city urban planning, transportation planning, and environmental impact analysis, are the technological components of societal change, having significant implications for research on the societal response to hazards and disasters. Social science researchers have used various technologies and methods to examine hazards and disasters through disciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary lenses. They have employed both quantitative and qualitative data collection and data analysis strategies. This study provides an overview of the current applications of AI in disaster management during its four phases and how AI is vital to all disaster management phases, leading to a faster, more concise, equipped response. Integrating a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) into disaster management enables higher planning, analysis, situational awareness, and recovery operations. GIS and RS are commonly recognized as key support tools for disaster management. Visualization capabilities, satellite images, and artificial intelligence analysis can assist governments in making quick decisions after natural disasters.

J	Rios, D				Rios, Diego			Present-day capitalist urbanization and unequal disaster risk production: the case of Tigre, Buenos Aires	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION			English	Article						disaster risk; flood; urban planning; urban transformations		This paper describes recent urban transformations in flood-prone areas on the outskirts of Buenos Aires that, prompted by a convergence of public-private interests, ignore the adverse consequences they generate and produce deeply unequal exposure to disaster risks. To illustrate these processes and their spatial results, the paper looks at the case of the municipality of Tigre, located to the north of the metropolis. I analyse the most substantive changes in public urban management and implementation of water management projects that have tended over recent decades to facilitate the operation of real estate/financial capital, through the development of degraded flood-prone risk areas that has made these the subject of dispute between antagonistic social groups.

The research adopted a mixed-method case study model that combines secondary sources and primary data gathering through semi-structured interviews of 25 returned market survivors, supported by 15 expert interviews among local and other government officials, practitioners and academics who are engaged in disaster management and urban planning. The empirical data reveal the importance of strengthening social relationships and cohesion as well as the crucial role of social capital in all stages of disaster management processes: prevention and preparedness, planning, warning communication, physical and psychological impacts, emergency and disaster response, recovery and reconstruction; and how these collectively motivate the survivors' return decision. Concluding, the paper opines that appreciating the interconnection and multidimensionality of social capital can enhance disaster management and optimistically opines that, that trajectory seems to be a crucial issue for future disaster research agendas.

J	Iizuka, S; Xuan, YL; Kondo, Y				Iizuka, Satoru; Xuan, Yingli; Kondo, Yumi			Impacts of disaster mitigation/prevention urban structure models on future urban thermal environment	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Urban thermal environment; Future projection; Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model; Urban structure; Disaster mitigation/prevention; Tsunami damage; Strong motion damage; Ground liquefaction damage	HEAT-ISLAND	The possibility of a huge earthquake and the following disasters, such as tsunami and ground liquefaction, in the near future has been pointed out in the third largest metropolitan area (Nagoya metropolitan area) in Japan. In the region including the Nagoya metropolitan area, a huge earthquake of magnitude 8 class has occurred every 100-150 years. The last huge earthquake in the region happened in 1944. Therefore, the viewpoint of disaster mitigation/prevention against an expected huge earthquake is crucial for future urban planning in the Nagoya metropolitan area. On the other hand, the population in the Nagoya metropolitan area is expected to decrease in the future. Such a decrease in population usually leads to a reduction of the urban area. In this study, three disaster mitigation/prevention urban structure models were designed for future urban planning of the 2050s (the target period in which about 100 years will have passed since the last huge earthquake) in the Nagoya metropolitan area considering a reduction in the urban area according to a projected decrease in population. Subsequently, the impacts of the introduction of the three disaster mitigation/prevention models, i.e., (1) a tsunami damage mitigation/prevention model, (2) a strong motion damage mitigation/prevention model, and (3) a ground liquefaction damage mitigation/prevention model, on the future (the 2050s) thermal environment were quantitatively investigated using a regional atmospheric model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Moreover, an urban structure model that combined the three disaster mitigation/prevention models was constructed, and the effect of the combined model on the future thermal environment was also evaluated.

Therefore, there is the case study that you want to point and reflect on how compliance with these principles and values are shown in the actual impacts of mining activity for Bento Rodrigues community in Mariana and the city Kiruna in Sweden. The municipality of Mariana, in Minas Gerais, gained international prominence recently because of the great environmental disaster resulting from the disruption of dam iron ore tailings in November 2015. Since Kiruna, a city north of Sweden, will be fully moved to a new location, a little more than three kilometers away. The aim then demonstrate from the documentary analysis and review of the literature how to set up urban planning in case of Mariana and Kiruna, assessing to what extent the right to the city was considered; assess to what extent the economic development stands in defense of human dignity in each case; and to compare the performance and state front paper analyzed the developments.

GIS has been applied in many areas to deal the geographic distribution of spatial features, such as natural resources management, land use management, urban planning, calamity monitoring and others. Currently, most of the GIS applications are based on two-dimensional (2D) vector data or images and are weak in handling three-dimensional (3D) spatial information. Although structural health monitoring information for bridges can be partially managed by 2D GIS, it would be much more efficient with a 3D GIS. This paper presents a design of structural health monitoring and management system for bridges based on 3D GIS. A discussion on the implementation of the design and analyze of the technique are also presented.

It argues that land-use planning can develop and apply spatial and physical resilience principles to disasters, contributing to developing meaningful ways of achieving resilience by bridging the space between overarching goals and the specificity of individual contexts, focusing on physical resistance. It concludes that there are nine design principles that can improve settlements resilience in wildfire-prone areas to reduce risks, organized under two major categories: acting on resistance and facilitating response.

However, sustainable development should comprise the improvements of disaster resilience. Moreover, past disaster events evidence that these POS have a significant potential to contribute to disaster management as a primary place to rescue and for shelters, as an agent of recovery, to provide essential life support and potential for adaptive response. Yet, lack of attempts have been made to harness this potential through the integration of disaster management strategies into planning and designing POS in cities. Accordingly, this ongoing research study aims to find out the innovative planning and designing methods, integrated with disaster management strategies to plan and design POS in cities. Accordingly, this research paper analyses the existing literature investigating the usage of POS in past disaster events and cross-compare the identified disaster management strategies with the sustainable planning and design strategies. Finally, the findings present five main approaches to integrate the disaster management strategies into planning and designing public open spaces. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

At present, the risk assessment in earthquake takes the empiricism primarily and analysis for complement. especially in urban master planning, as we can see, in the case of the large planning area, the difficulty in obtaining information, a wide variety of planning contents and so on, we confront a lot of difficulties in the construction of a model and the correlative analysis when we are doing the risk assessment of earthquake disasters. In this research, Base on SHANTOU city, with the quantitative and qualitative research, discussing how to do the earthquake risk analysis in the city master planning, which provide some basis for the division of urban disaster prevention space and the layout planning of the disaster prevention facilities.

J	Platt, S; So, E				Platt, Stephen; So, Emily			Speed or deliberation: a comparison of post-disaster recovery in Japan, Turkey, and Chile	DISASTERS			English	Article						earthquake; recovery; resilience; tsunami; urban planning	URBAN TRANSFORMATION; EARTHQUAKE; DISASTER; TSUNAMI; RISK	This paper compares recovery in the wake of three recent earthquakes: the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011; the Van earthquake in Turkey in October 2011; and the Maule earthquake in Chile in February 2010. The authors visited all three locations approximately 12-18 months after the incidents and interviewed earthquake specialists, disaster managers, urban planners, and local authorities. A key challenge to post-disaster recovery planning is balancing speed and deliberation. While affected communities must rebuild as quickly as possible, they must also seek to maximise the opportunities for improvement that disasters provide. The three case studies bring this dilemma into stark relief, as recovery was respectively slow, fast, and just right in the aftermath of the events: the Government of Japan adopted a deliberate approach to recovery and reconstruction; speed was of the essence in Turkey; and an effective balance between speed and deliberation was achieved in Chile.

J	Biasillo, R; Armiero, M				Biasillo, Roberta; Armiero, Marco			The transformative potential of a disaster: a contextual analysis of the 1882 flood in Verona, Italy	JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Flood; Disasters; Urban planning; Forest policy; Political ecology		This article explores institutional responses to and societal understandings of the 1882 Adige flood in northern Italy, which particularly affected the city of Verona. The article investigates the transformative power of that disaster on a national scale in terms of forest policy and at a city level in terms of water management and urban planning. After the flood, an extensive programme of works aiming to contain and discipline both the river and its adjacent city dwellers coexisted with the launch of forest conservation and reforestation plans. This flood and its recovery phase incorporated and materialized the early Italian state's relationship to the natural world. We interpret the flood as providing an opportunity for redirecting Italy's local and national flood management strategies, triggering an explicit awareness of the interrelation between lowlands and highlands and enhancing modernization processes in many respects. Despite its historical and symbolic relevance, this flood has not yet been fully researched and poses crucial questions about ways of organising and selectively obliterating collective memories of disasters.

J	Talia, M				Talia, Michele			The time profile of transformations in territorial governance Towards a meeting point between urban planning and risk management	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Strategic planning; Decision-making system; Simplifying procedures		As a result of the close relationship with the School of Architecture founded in 1919, Italian urban planning has often been marked by a search for a difficult balance between spatial and temporal projections in plans, often favouring the former over the latter. Due to this unequal development in planning contents, territorial governance has shown a worrying loss of authority, which tends to generate evident contradictions when territorial planning is called to contend with problems deriving from the management of areas where urban planning forecasts must coexist with extraordinary provisions adopted following an earthquake or other natural disaster. In this recurring difficulty of finding space within ordinary planning procedures for measures designed to address the emergency, three starting conditions prove to be decisive. The first is the need to guarantee the availability of a rigorous cognitive framework to allow an increasingly complex and unstable planning system to be based on rich, detailed information. The second is the requirement to reduce the gap between the technical times necessary to develop planning tools and the necessary promptness for procedures to coordinate emergency policies. The third is the need to entrust strategic documents with the task of balancing the relationship between the short and long terms, both in urban planning and in emergency plans.

Worldwide, there are a lot of laws and regulations addressing this problem, as well as different models and approaches developed for flooding risk assessment at different stages of urban planning. The aim of this work is to review the existing measures for prevention of floods that threaten the security of the human population, flora and fauna. The study focuses on the necessary measures which must be implemented to tackle the problem, and early warning of population in emergency and disaster situations in order to reduce damage from floods. Existing statistical data is reviewed and analyzed and, as a consequence, recommendations are proposed.

Urban flood disaster management	URBAN WATER JOURNAL			English	Article						urban hydroinformatics; digital city; disaster management; forecasting; GIS; monitoring; simulation modelling; urban floods; flood warning systems	SIMULATION; SYSTEM	Disaster management for urban areas is a growing priority owing to factors such as the relentless migration to cities, unplanned development, changing climate, and increasing operational and maintenance costs. New information and communication technologies offer improved opportunities to address these factors. This paper presents and describes the digital city concept as a means of capturing, analysing and applying (digital) information about the city area, its services, and their design and operation. In particular, the functionality of the digital city can be adapted for managing urban flood disasters. The paper highlights the need to manage the urban stormwater cycle integrated with urban planning. Urban flooding should be mitigated by having a judicious mix of both structural and nonstructural strategies, which are selected with the full participation of all stakeholders. The management of urban flooding is illustrated with application to the tropical island of St Maarten.	[Price, R.

J	Tate, J				Tate, Jennie			Fights and Fires are the Flowers of Edo	DESIGN JOURNAL			English	Article						design and urban planning; built environment; disaster; Tokyo		It has been common in post-enlightenment Western society to view binary pairs as oppositional in nature. I wish to interrogate how the narratives of our society determine our evaluation and response to disaster and events which create disorder in our lives. What is the role of design when cities are re-built and re-constructed, after 'disaster' (natural and man-made) alters the material and physical 'face' of the urban environment? By changing our relationship to binary pairs from an oppositional view, can we transform the design and inhabitation of the urban landscape? This is an environment that is increasingly perceived, particularly by Western thought, as alienating, hostile and sterile. The locus of my research is the city of Tokyo, and how it has transitioned from the Edo of the Tokugawa Regime 1600-1863. This was a city with a built materiality of wood and paper, which through repeated destruction, has re-emerged as contemporary Tokyo - a city of concrete and glass. This will be illustrated firstly, by the way in which the various 'mappings' of the urban environment are a visual expression of its metaphysics; and secondly, by how they underpin urban planning and design. 'Fights and Fires are the Flowers of Edo' is an expression that was popular during the Tokugawa Regime. This period was a time of constant conflagration and upheaval as the result of repeated earthquakes. More recently, events have included flooding and firebombing. However this upheaval always preceded a resurgence of life. The term 'Fights and Fires are the Flowers of Edo' is indicative of the process of renewal and creation as an integral part of destruction. This paper specifically examines the way in which narratives written, oral and visual - determine our relationship to binary pairs and the way in which they provide the conceptual framework for design and urban planning. The paper will also interrogate whether these narratives of resilience have permeated the new materiality of concrete and glass. The conclusion will demonstrate the consequences this has for design and urban planning. The theoretical perspectives that this paper calls on are the interface of science and metaphysics through the Poetics of Space as significant for meaningful inhabitation within the built environment. The organising principle of this multidisciplinary approach is Narrative Inquiry which will be employed to examine the role that the myths, cosmologies, maps and metaphysics of Japanese culture play in the design and reconstruction of the urban environment.

J	Fekete, A				Fekete, Alexander			Critical infrastructure and flood resilience: Cascading effects beyond water	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						critical infrastructure; disaster resilience; flood management; flood risk; flood risk management	DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; VULNERABILITY; SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; GERMANY; RECOVERY; FAILURES; IMPACTS	Critical infrastructure and cascading effects are analyzed in this article as cross-cutting topics in flood risk and resilience. A concept is developed for integrating aspects of disaster risk, hazard, vulnerability and resilience with critical infrastructure analytic components such as redundancy, rapidity or resourcefulness. These components are expressed for each phase of an unfolding flood event and cascading effects are indicated, too. This contribution discusses the implications of such a conceptual frame for the advancement of existing flood risk management concepts. Current international guiding strategies such as the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the "Making Cities Resilient" campaigns in field of urban disaster resilience, Climate Change Adaptation processes such as the Paris Agreement of the IPCC process, or urban planning in the field of UN HABITAT are all interconnected to the topic of (critical) infrastructure. The article shows how flood risk management can connect to such wider international developments by the conceptual frame discussion presented.

The best way to solve this problem is to develop the underground space (including tunnels). With the exhaustion and saturation of the shallow underground space, the development of urban area is more and more relying on the excavation of deep underground space. Nowadays, the advanced technology of high strength concrete, excavation method in soft soil and ground deformation control make it possible to build underground space with a larger scale, span length and depth. The common disasters and hazards that large urban underground space faces are the same as that of ordinary underground space, but considering the damage and the rescue difficulties, more attention should be paid to the influence of disasters on large underground space. The study and research on the evaluation of the disaster prevention system of underground space still have not raised enough attention yet. The Comprehensive Evaluation of the disaster prevention system is set up based on the study of the characteristics of large underground space itself and disaster effects.

This is the primary seismic belt that has the most and strongest earthquakes. Particularly, the 921 earthquake in 1999 signaled a lack of urban planning system and disaster prevention plan. However, formulating urban disaster prevention plan, it is found that the distance between shelter and home is an important selection factor and the designation of evacuation range is currently an important subject. This study is aimed at the designation of urban evacuation range, and estimate the population within the range by utilizing the spatial attribute data established in the geographic information system, as the basis of shelter service scope. Graph overlapping is also conducted with the estimated shelter serviced range (circle) in different designations to compare different disaster prevention plans and describe the effect of effective shelter range on promoting disaster prevention work. The results can be used as references for temporary urban refuge for earthquake and designation of evacuation range.

J	Johnson, C; Blackburn, S				Johnson, Cassidy; Blackburn, Sophie			Advocacy for urban resilience: UNISDR's Making Cities Resilient Campaign	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION			English	Article						planning; local government; urban; disaster; resilience; risk reduction	CLIMATE-CHANGE	This paper reviews what local governments in more than 50 cities are doing with regard to disaster risk reduction. It draws on the reports of their participation in the global Making Cities Resilient Campaign and its 10 "essential" components, and on interviews with city mayors or managers. These show how resilience to disasters is being conceived and addressed by local governments, especially with regard to changes in their institutional framework and engagement with communities and other stakeholders, also in mobilizing finance, undertaking multi-hazard risk assessments, upgrading informal settlements, adjusting urban planning and implementing building codes. The paper summarizes what city mayors or managers view as key milestones for building resilience, and further discusses their evaluation of the usefulness of the campaign to them. It also discusses how a local government-focused perspective on disaster risk reduction informs our understanding of resilience. This includes how development can contribute much to disaster risk reduction as well as a more tangible and operational understanding of resilience (resistance + coping capacity + recovery + adaptive capacity) that local governments can understand and act on.

The disaster-prevention control in mountainous urban design is based on following guideline achievements conformed by disaster-prevention planning for mountainous urban: the urban planar structure, land use, road traffic, and etc.. It offers a more direct method to deal with the relationship among three-dimensional mountainous urban space environment, human, disasters, and so on. It also becomes a main link between disaster-prevention planning for mountainous urban and disaster-prevention design for mountainous architecture. Through the analysis on correlative literatures and studies, this article summed up 6 pieces of comprehensive controlling items and 28 pieces of detailed controlling factors. In case of Chongqing City, focusing on different professional respondents of urban planning administrators, urban designers, research and teaching stuffs, a questionnaire survey and an analytic hierarchy process (A.H.P) were applied for factor weight studies. Then this research drew a conclusion of the weight taxis of the factors in disaster-prevention control in mountainous urban design by synthetically analyzing the different evaluations from the administrators, urban designers and researchers. The achievement can be a reference and a meteyard of the design productions in further administration and practices of disaster-prevention control in mountainous urban design, and then put the urban disaster-prevention planning into effect concretely in the three-dimensional space environment of mountainous cities.

GIS has been applied in many areas to deal with the geographic distribution of spatial features, such as natural resources management, urban planning, calamity monitoring and others. Currently, most of the GIS applications are based on two-dimensional (2D) vectors or images and are weak in handling three-dimensional (3D) spatial information. Although structural health monitoring information for bridges can be partially managed by 2D GIS, it would be much more efficient with a 3D GIS. This paper presents a design of structural health monitoring and management system for bridges based on 3D GIS. A discussion on the implementation of the design and analysis of the technique are also presented.

J	Norizan, NZA; Hassan, N; Yusoff, MM				Norizan, Nur Zainul Arifin; Hassan, Norhaslina; Yusoff, Mariney Mohd			Strengthening flood resilient development in malaysia through integration of flood risk reduction measures in local plans	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Resilience; Disaster risk reduction; Flood risk reduction; Urban planning; Local plan	ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; CITIES	The increasing flood hazards due to climate change and development pressures have called for the integration of disaster resilient attributes through holistic flood risk reduction measures in development plans. Strengthening flood resilience in development planning therefore is not only to prevent risk, but also to reduce vulnerability as well as inculcate preparedness to adapt and better respond to disaster. In Malaysia, the notion of disaster resilience has become a recent development agenda in response to disaster risks especially flooding since the country is highly prone to such hazard. Flood reduction measures have become the key elements in Malaysia's development plans at all levels, but little is known about the range of such measures being integrated in local development plan, which is a statutory development plan that guides planning control decisions and enable local communities to participate in local development agenda. Therefore, this study seeks to analyse the extent to which flood risk reduction measures are being integrated into local plans in Malaysia towards flood resiliency. The study, however, is limited to qualitative approach based on literature and content analysis of selected local plans. The finding suggests that all studied plans have integrated most measures to avoid risk and reduce vulnerability although measures on disaster preparedness were inadequate. There is a need thus, to further strengthen disaster resilience measures in the local development plans to ingrain preparedness and adaptation with more inclusive participatory civil societies and stakeholders.

It helps in conducting planning activities where the economic, environmental, and social goals are taken care of holistically. Planning process involves studying past trends, learning from past and present, and then preparing a proposal for future. This process mostly assesses the trend of growth and plans for development. A trend follows change in a defined rate. An indefinite or unexpected change spoils the planning process, by breaking the trend of growth. City is known for its resources, geography, population, social-culture structure, economy etc. Whenever there is an unexpected change in any of these parameters, the city undergoes remarkable changes. Disaster also brings hasty changes in all these, which is indeed a challenge to urban planning and design. The fast modernization and adoption of western culture leads to significant changes in socio-cultural and economic spheres. City also changes, when rapid movement of people and resources occur. Tourism industry in this decade brought many changes is Indian cities. It diversifies social and cultural identity of the city and generates tremendous opportunity for economic development. Therefore cities having tourism potential are facing urban planning problems. Exploring these issues and reasons behind it will be helpful to minimize its impact. Tourism cities have tremendous potential of research in this direction. The need of the decade for urban planners and designers is to be prepared for the changes in a tourist city.

The emergency is to develop pandemic-resilient city planning and management in order to tackle the infectious diseases during COVID-19. Such development includes the reframing of unsustainable urban patterns, hazards, and social inequalities to be prepared for the emerging cases. In this study, we focus on the assessment of disaster risk management (DRM), which will help to develop pandemic-resilient urban strategies (response, mitigation, and preparedness phase) through analyzing previously published literature. Short- and long-term recommendations for pandemic resilience urban planning and design have also been provided. In the response phase, implementation of the smart and resilient city design and policies has been highlighted to identify disease transmission. In the mitigation phase, new technological approaches can be adopted for better management of present and future pandemics. The physical (urban access, infrastructure, environmental factors, and land use patterns) and non-physical (socio-cultural, governance, and economic factors) aspects of resilient urban strategies have been focused, which may help to develop understanding of health- and disaster-related risks in pandemic. In the preparedness phase, proactive measures such as capacity building of people toward any outbreak and different simulation processes (models of transmission pattern) can be adopted for future pandemics. We also discuss about the enhancement of urban resiliency in housing, public spaces, and cities that may bring the effective outcome of DRM framework to combat pandemic. The study focuses on the major lessons that can be adopted for post-pandemic urban resilient planning related to disaster management and climate change adaptation, preventing extensive challenges of sustainability apart. In the following months and years, it will be difficult to assess various changes to develop urban planning and design in the post-COVID-19 world. However, this study expresses the possibility of creating good opportunities for policymakers and city planners to undertake significant transformative and advanced actions during the three different phases of DRM. This study presents a novel approach to delineate the scope of DRM framework in achieving more resilient cities (RC) to tackle future pandemics. This study will also crucially help the planners and decision-makers in better assessing and addressing the strategic and resilient urban design and planning approach in future.

This study seeks to describe the dimensions of community resilience in the face of the threat of an active geological fault in the foothills of the Metropolitan Region of Chile. A questionnaire was applied to 43 social leaders of Penalolen, subsequently, a statistical analysis of the 27 closed items was held and a quantitative thematic analysis of the three opened items. The results indicate five key dimensions of community resilience: governance; risk assessment; cultural knowledge and education; risk management and vulnerability reduction and organizational strategies for disaster preparedness and response. Finally, the importance of these dimensions of community resilience in contexts of chronic and overlapping vulnerabilities is discussed, while highlighting the need to develop better institutional measures for prevention, preparedness and response to disasters.

J	Wamsler, C				Wamsler, Christine			Integrating risk reduction, urban planning and housing: Lessons from El Salvador	OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						disasters; risk reduction; urban planning; housing; El Salvador		Increasingly, attention has been given to the need to mainstream risk reduction in development work in order to reduce the vulnerability of the urban poor. Using El Salvador as a case study, the paper analyses the mainstreaming process in the developmental disciplines of urban planning and housing. The overall aim is to identify how the existing separation between risk reduction, urban planning and housing can be overcome and integration achieved. Since Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and especially after the 2001 earthquakes, not only relief and development organisations, but also social housing organisations hove initiated a shift to include risk reduction in their fields of action in order to address the underlying causes of urban vulnerability. The factors that triggered the process were: 7) the negative experiences of organisations with non-integral projects, 2) the organisations' increased emphasis on working with municipal development, 3) political changes of national level, and more importantly, 4) the introduction and promotion of the concept of risk reduction by international and regional aid organisations. However, required additional knowledge and institutional capacities were mainly built up independently and internally by each organisation, and not through the creation of co-operative partnerships, thus duplicating efforts and increasing ineffective competition. Whilst positive experience has been gained through the implementation of more integral projects, the creation of adequate operational, organisational, institutional and legal frameworks is still in its initial stage. Unfortunately, four years after the 200 7 earthquakes, emergency relief funding for post-disaster risk reduction is coming to on end without the allocation of resources for following up and consolidating the initial process. Based on the findings, on integral model is proposed which shows how mainstreaming risk reduction in urban planning and housing could be dealt with in such a way that it becomes more integrated, inclusive and sustainable within a developmental context.

This strategy has been implemented in the city of Limbe, which is known to be a disaster-prone one. Citizens are forced to settle in unsafe terrains, ranging from wetlands to unstable hillslopes due to the city's geographical location and economic attraction. Following the fatal landslides and floods in 2001, a local crisis committee identified affected areas and declared them 'risk zones' to prevent further exposure. Empirically, this study narrates the production and implementation of risk zonation policy in the city of Limbe. Theoretically, it uses an urban political ecology perspective, which incorporates science and technology studies, post-political theory and disaster research to interpret the drivers and implications of the mismatch between research, policy and action. In this case study, we investigate the implications for disaster risk reduction by describing three underlying socio-political drivers of the risk zonation policy: (i) authoritarian science regime, (ii) post-political discourse, and (iii) blame diversion. We argue that authorities from national to local level use a post-political discourse to promote and implement disaster risk reduction in the city of Limbe through the development and the application of risk zonation policy. As a consequence, risk zonation leads to poor enforcement of the law and corruption, ultimately leading to risk accumulation in this case. This analysis allows us to draw broader conclusions on drivers and implications of the implementation of disaster risk zonation policy in urban areas that are primarily governed hierarchically and prone to corruption.

J	Vigano, P				Vigano, Paola			Extreme Cities and Bad Places	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						Bordeaux; risk and sustainability; urban and territorial design; urban development scenario construction; Venice; water management		This article considers places where climate change-induced hazards will be particularly important, focusing on two examples, the lagoon location of Venice and the Garonne riverbank location of Bordeaux. The Venice lagoon territory is close to the coast and has a dispersed form of urban development. Our project experiments resulted in the formulation of a series of adaptation strategies to increased disaster risks, including returning current agricultural land and residential areas to their original state as wetlands and marshes before their reclamation during the early decades of the twentieth century. The scenarios introduce space as a relevant variable into the debate about the impact of climate change and adaptation. This article also deals with the recovery of "bad places," such as the urban blight on the Garonne riverbanks of Bordeaux, and their relationship with sustainability and disaster risks. Increasingly, the emphasis on minimizing energy consumption and promoting recycling forces cities to reuse places of elevated risk. Only very recently in modern urban planning are polluted and risky areas frequently selected for new development projects to reclaim the vast areas of existing brownfields in the name of sustainability. Integrating disaster risk reduction into a new economic and social context has thus become an extremely important part of contemporary urban design and planning for these reclaimed ( bad) areas. The research concludes that urban and territorial design should and can integrate the inevitability of risk. This is necessary for developing approaches and strategies that offer some rethinking about "wicked" problems, long-term time horizons, radical imagination, dynamic representations, and minute territorial readings in contemporary urban planning.

J	Myers, G; Walz, J; Jumbe, A				Myers, Garth; Walz, Jonathan; Jumbe, Aboud			Trends in urban planning, climate adaptation and resilience in Zanzibar, Tanzania	TOWN AND REGIONAL PLANNING			English	Article						Adaptation; global climate change; policy interventions; urban planning; Zanzibar		Over recent decades, there has been substantial change in Zanzibar, due to, among others, global climate change impacts. The semi-autonomous polity faces challenges to foster resilient urban communities and planning for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, not least because of its island nature and rapid urbanization. This article addresses urban and environmental planning measures from 2010 to 2020 aimed at confronting the impacts of climate change and working toward resilience and adaptation in urban Zanzibar. The study was conducted between June and August 2020, and primarily involved a combination of desktop studies, online discussions, and virtual meetings with key actors in the land, climate, and disaster risk policy and governance aspects in Zanzibar. The review provides information on the current responses to policy, legal and institutional setup in terms of the key issues related to land use, climate and disaster risk reduction in Zanzibar. Thematic analysis was used to connect land-use planning, climate adaptation, and disaster risk reduction documentation of the situational assessment, determination and respective recommendations concerning land use and climate adaptation. It is argued that planning for climate change requires greater social will, financial investment, and the conversion of science to policy than currently exists in Zanzibar. Dynamic individual and governmental efforts and select community engagement are likely insufficient to produce resilience, as large-scale donor-funded climate adaptation interventions are largely top-down in orientation and often miss out on local community-oriented climate solutions. Smaller NGOs are more practical for understanding and addressing community-oriented priorities to support climate-resilient initiatives and enhance local livelihood priorities and participation against climate impacts, including natural disasters and everyday degradation.

The monitoring and loss assessment after the typhoon disaster is an important basis for the scientific decision-making in the disaster prevention, mitigation and reconstruction. The traditional artificial method of outdoor investigation after the disasters needs a lot of manpower, material resources. And it also has the inefficiency and the risk. In this paper, taken the Jimei Street in Xiamen City after the typhoon disaster as the research area and taken the data monitoring and the recovery status after the disaster as the research background. We took advantage of the UAV aerial imagery and did the post-disaster imagery data analysis which was based on ArcGIS. Then we established the image interpretation marks of the multi-objective disaster affected bodies and outputted the interpretation results. It could intuitively and accurately reflect the disaster loss status, and finally it could realize the disaster data visualization; Based on the Model Builder, we did the roughly screen of the surface features with the multi-period DSM and DOM data in the different time periods. Based on the vector data and the DSM raster data, we did the precisely and quickly statistical analysis for the ecological restoration status and reconstruction of the building houses, the vegetation areas and the road vegetation in different periods. In the end, the recovery effect of the natural ecological environment after the disaster was got. The research results shows that based the UAV image data can quickly assess and analyze the disaster areas' loss and disaster recovery. It could provide the technical support and the decision support for the urban disaster emergency rescue, for the ecological restoration monitoring and for the urban planning and the restoration.

Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery using Eigen Features	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICCSP)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)	APR 06-08, 2017	Melmaruvathur, INDIA	IEEE		Aerial imagery; Histogram of Oriented Gradients; Singular Value Decomposition; Support Vector Machine; Vehicle detection		The invention of low cost optical sensors lead to a rapid exploitation of aerial images in numerous applications. Automatic vehicle detection in aerial images is remarkably employed in traffic safety, urban planning, military, parking lot management, aerial surveillance, catastrophe and disaster management. The huge amount of data collected in such tasks enforce to automate the detection process. The objective of this work is to detect small vehicles from aerial images in an unconstrained environment. The experiments are conducted on the VEDAI dataset. The architecture of the system includes two phases namely training and detection. The training phase includes cropping and extraction of the training samples, feature representation and classification. And the detection phase consists of extracting the regions of interest, feature extraction and classification. The vehicles occupy only less than 1 % of total pixels in the image. Hence to limit the search area, an edge detection is performed as a pre-processing step. The bounding boxes that are selected after applying size constraint are classified using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Two feature extraction techniques are utilized in this work specifically singular value decomposition (SVD) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). From the experimental results analyzed based on overall classification accuracy, the proposed SVD features provide a comparable performance with existing HOG features.

While the districts that sprang up after the natural disaster as a swift solution to the housing emergency showed a fragmented urban planning policy, the urban projects of Marconi sought to promote, an extensive variety of building types, the creation of large green areas and a close relationship with the local landscape, aiming above all to make these settlements autonomous. If they had been built with all the planned social facilities, these housing complexes could have easily recreated the social and urban conditions of the historic city districts.

This paper aims to construct models that describe the spatiotemporal distribution of population in urban areas. The models are composed of parameters describing the number of persons per unit floor-area of buildings, which varies according to the time fluctuation factors and the location factors, and are calibrated using a person trip survey data and GIS data. We discuss the characteristics of the spatiotemporal distribution of population and the accuracy of the models, and demonstrate that the proposed models can benefit all phases of urban planning, which include risk assessment and disaster management.

This change has resulted in a higher frequency and increased intensity of natural disasters. Habitat and development types even cause complex disaster types. In 2005, the report of Natural Disaster Hotspots-A Global Risk Analysis declared that 73% of world population and land area are exposed to more than three types of natural disasters. Ninety-nine percent of the land area and population are exposed to natural disasters worldwide. These above records are much higher than those of other countries worldwide. Taiwanese people face high risks of natural disasters. The present study attempts to look into sustainable development policies that seek to prevent disasters through an expert questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire are further analysed with methodologies of the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and analytic network process (ANP). The analyses suggest that disaster prevention strategies should be prioritised in urban planning, accounting for the effects of climate change. In addition to disaster prevention and mitigation, pre-disaster preparation in daily life is critical because it ensures the execution of appropriate emergency responses in the event of a disaster. Although the current mainstream environmental policy emphasises non-structural mitigation, conventional structural mitigation remains imperative. By and large, the priority of disaster prevention strategy in Taiwan must be land use management and planning, as well as the public advocacy and training.

J	Orhan, E				Orhan, Ezgi			An Evaluation on Planning Legislation Following the 1999 Earthquakes	PLANLAMA-PLANNING			Turkish	Article						Disaster planning; disaster risk reduction; planning legislation	MANDATES; PLANS	Following the 1999 Earthquakes stricken Marmara Region, as the most populated, urbanized and industrialized region of the country, large-scale recovery efforts have been initiated; and in addition to central and local administrations, many institutions and civil societies have become the part of these studies. However, in the face of the devastating effects of the 1999 Earthquakes, significant steps have been taken in legal framework due to its limitedness in guiding disaster policies. Besides, development of the risk management approach at the international level has triggered countries to review their policies and legal regulations shaping their disaster management. Based on this need, the study examines the legislation that shapes the disaster policies and guides spatial planning in our country and its change in the meantime. The legal regulations that have been added to the urban planning legislation in the last 20 years for the purpose of risk mitigation have been discussed. To this end, Article 73 of the "Municipality Law" (no. 5393), "Law on Conservation of Deteriorating Historic and Cultural Property through Renewal and Re-use" (no. 5366), "Law on the Transformation of Areas at Disaster Risk" (no. 6306), and Temporary Article 16 of Development Law (no. 3194) (Peace of Reconstruction) are determined as the main regulation shaping policies for reducing urban risks, and evaluated within the scope of the study. Therefore, this study puts forward the problems and criticisms regarding the implementation of legal arrangements established for the purpose of mitigating urban risks as well as recovery of the disaster-prone areas.

J	Kammerbauer, M; Wamsler, C				Kammerbauer, Mark; Wamsler, Christine			Risk Management without Risk Reduction? The Role of Social Vulnerability in Post-Disaster Recovery after Floods in Germany	RAUMFORSCHUNG UND RAUMORDNUNG-SPATIAL RESEARCH AND PLANNING			German	Article						Environmental disaster; Flood; Vulnerability; Recovery; Building back better; Risk management; Urban planning; Resilience		Environmental and climate hazards, such as floods, increasingly cause damages in cities and urbanised areas in Germany. The capacity of the impacted populations to cope with the outcome of related disasters is, amongst others, influenced by their vulnerability. Vulnerability reduction is thus key for creating social or structural resilience. This is particularly the case during post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. Recovery planning is, per definition, supposed to enable improvement, rather than a reconstruction of the status quo. However, which role does vulnerability play in recovery projects, and what kind of a recovery can improved planning lead to as a result? Based on a case study of the flood disaster of the river Danube in 2013, and particularly the Bavarian city of Deggendorf, we investigate these questions. From 2013 to 2018, data was collected by means of a survey, a spatial analysis and qualitative interviews. The results show how particular social vulnerabilities strongly influence the individual access to resources required during recovery and reconstruction as well as the capacity to deal with long-term disaster impacts. We conclude that recovery and development planning needs to acknowledge such vulnerabilities to a higher degree. The article contributes to discussions on the societal and governance causes for social vulnerability and is oriented towards actors responsible for planning and disaster management as well as the increasingly impacted public.

Using a cellular automata-random forest model, we considered two scenarios to predict intra-land use changes in Kumamoto City from 2018 to 2030: an unconstrained development scenario, and a planning-constrained development scenario that considers disaster-related factors. The random forest was used to calculate the transition probabilities and the importance of driving factors, and cellular automata were used for future land use prediction. The results show that disaster-related factors greatly influence land vacancy, while urban planning factors are more important for medium high-rise residential, commercial, and public facilities. Under the unconstrained development scenario, urban land use tends towards spatially disordered growth in the total amount of steady growth, with the largest increase in low-rise residential areas. Under the planning-constrained development scenario that considers disaster-related factors, the urban land area will continue to grow, albeit slowly and with a compact growth trend. This study provides planners with information on the relevant trends in different scenarios of land use change in Kumamoto City.

Drilling is the most common way to survey the geological environment of the research area. However, how to determine the locations of the boreholes reasonably is an important problem. We have adopted the Delaunay Refinement technique to determine the location of boreholes. Delaunay Refinement technique can generate relatively well-distributed triangular mesh by inserting some new points at the circumcenter of triangles. In the engineering practice, ZhengDong new district neededto carry out a geological disaster investigation. The government required the distance between any two boreholes not to exceed 1.5 kilometers to guaranteeaccuracy. The existing 40 boreholes data, collected from the constructed buildings, along with the border of ZhengDong new district as the constrained conditions, the locations of new boreholes can be determined the by Delaunay Refinement. The locations of new inserting points just are what we needed. Using this method, the optimal layout of boreholes can be achieved. Thus, this method produces not only a rational result, but also reduces the cost.

For this, an action research methodology was applied, structured from participatory popular education scenarios with a neighborhood community: El Pacifico, located in the upper part of Comuna 8, on the northeast slope of Medellin. Based on this proposal, a community risk management and disaster prevention plan was formulated, contemplating the identification of socio-territorial threats, risk reduction measures, and a programmatic component. Taking these results as a reference, we discuss the implications of community risk management and its ability to reduce the gap in socio-spatial inequities. In conclusion, community disaster risk management, combined with popular education practices and interaction between academia, the community, social organizations, and government institutions, can serve as a key practice for the realization of spatial and environmental justice in the city of Medellin.

Examining the urban dwellings vulnerability to this natural disaster is one of the main objects of the urban planning. To evaluate the vulnerability status of the district 13 housing to natural disasters such as earthquake, was the aim of the present study. The methodology of this study was descriptive-analytical and in the term of goal, it was practical. The data were analyzed by Expert Choice, ArcGIS applications and AHP model. The results indicated that, after analyzing, the most vulnerability was attributed to the region 1 to the natural disaster such as an earthquake, and then regions 2, 3, and 4 were placed in the subsequent ranking; this showed that the four aforementioned districts were not identical in the term of the vulnerability indexes, but different from each other.

Rapid urbanization in developing countries generally follows unregulated growths, urban sprawls, and inefficiencies in city planning. With the trend of rapid growth in developing countries, it has been very difficult to maintain an environmentally sustainable and socially resilient policy framework. This study proposes an urban development policy framework for sustainable planning in developing cities by coupling geographic information system (GIS) geospatial zonal analysis with strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model. The hybridized approach incorporates critical issues such as disaster impact, slum settlements, infrastructure deficit, and noise pollution in urban planning. A case study of the city of Delhi was taken to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in developing cities. The novelty of the study is that it proposes a highly flexible urban development plan based on the integrated GIS and SWOT-AHP methodology that is specific to the needs of developing economies and developing cities. The methodology also puts a strong emphasis on disaster prevention and response in the urban development plan. Results from the GIS-SWOT-AHP model can be used for region-based urban planning that prioritizes regions needing critical attention and directs the development of the city toward a sustainable future.

Particularly, social network posts with their location information are becoming more important because they can be utilized for emergency management, urban planning, and various studies to understand effects of the disasters. Despite their importance, the percentage of such posts is generally tiny. In this paper, to address the location sparsity problem on Twitter in the event of disasters, we propose a deep learning-based framework to spatially analyze the disaster-related tweets by focusing on classifying tweets from affected areas of disasters. We also study effects of different deep learning architectures and input embedding techniques for this classification task. Our experimental results demonstrate that our ConvNet model with the Word2vec word embedding has the highest classification accuracy.

The present paper discusses the concept and evolution of machizukuri from a social movement to soft-infrastructure' at city level, focused on serving community needs in post-disaster settings. The 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in Kobe is chosen as the main case study, in order to review the role and process of machizukuri in disaster management in the context of urban renewal. This is followed by a discussion on the possibility of replicating this model in other contexts and the challenges which machizukuri and similar bottom-up groups are faced with in ensuring their sustainability. The paper argues that the culture and personal engagement of the citizens, and the commitment of national and local governments to cooperate with civil society groups, are essential in this process. Finally, the study suggests that the utilization of this concept has proved that there are undeniable benefits in engaging civil society in decision-making processes and initiatives, with the ultimate aim to create communities capable of overcoming the catastrophic consequences of disasters.

J	Kamat, R				Kamat, Rajshree			Planning and managing earthquake and flood prone towns	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Disaster risk; Disaster management; Master plan; Earthquake damage scenario; Flood damage scenario		Before commencement of any planning and management activities, to mitigate the disastrous consequences of man-made and natural disasters, it is necessary to analyze the potential hazard underlying in the area and work out consequences of disasters. Disasters can result in failed development, but failures in development planning can also lead to disaster risk, which is the case in most of the cities which are disaster prone in developing countries. The researcher has tried to respond to the unique challenge presented by the Indian cities which are earthquake and flood prone, by developing earthquake and flood damage scenario by utilizing-appropriate damage assessment criteria after studying the literature survey, building and infrastructure inventories, topographical information, demographical data and other relevant facts and figures to propose an urban planning model to minimize the damages. The developed planning model has to be inserted into master plan for future development of the area. The master plan should be integrated with the Disaster Management Plan. In the present study, the organizational structure existing in the Hoshangabad district for Disaster Management is studied along with the incident command system (ICS) a standardized method of managing disasters. In view of the multifarious and multi jurisdictional functions involved, the ICS with appropriate modifications can be adopted here as a management tool hence District Headquarters Team for Hoshangabad has been proposed. A conceptual model has been proposed based on the methodology of the research work which can be utilized for similar towns.

Further with the increasing unplanned rapid urbanization, the disasters (in terms of frequency and numbers) and their impacts are increasing, which is primarily associated with badly planned and managed urban development, degraded ecosystems, and poverty. According to a study by the United Nations, almost 890 million people (60 %) across the globe live in cities that are at risk from at least one major natural disaster, including floods, droughts, cyclones, or earthquakes. Disasters eventually wipe off years of development and cause death, injury, economic losses, and environmental and urban systems' degradation. Since a city is an integration of complicated urban systems like transportation, water supply, sanitation, housing, and other urban infrastructure and services, strengthening these systems will increase the resilience and help in disaster management in urban areas. On the other hand, smart cities use information and communications technology (ICT) to involve people, improve city services, and enhance urban systems which in turn will improve disaster resilience. To make cities disaster resilient right at the inception stage, the efficiency in urban planning can have a major impact on communities' preparedness and capacities to recover. Smart growth strategies like creating flexible land-use policies, targeting public investment, and engaging the entire community in making decisions can help communities recover from a disaster, rebuild according to a shared community vision, and be better prepared for a disaster. This paper tries to explore through various examples those aspects of smart cities which build and assist in disaster resilience of cities. The study clearly indicates that the relation between smart development and disaster resilience is strong, where the smart growth, smart urbanization (smart grids, eco-cities, compact development), and low-carbon footprint strategies have been used and are some of the most needed consideration to deal with the present scale of disasters in urban areas.

During this complex process, efforts are centred to the provision of housing and basic infrastructure. In general, the limited land available restricts opportunities for high-quality spatial design within the settlements to optimize the land and provide the maximum number of houses possible. Open spaces in these settlements are rarely considered during the planning and implementation of the projects, and consequently there is little scholarship of community space. However, the importance of open spaces to the community and the liveability of these new settlements depend on the interactions which spontaneously take place in these areas. This study explores the different uses and characteristics of open spaces in temporary and permanent resettlement sites established in the aftermath of major disasters in Japan and the Philippines. This study addresses the limitations of the immediate post-disaster urban planning, compared to the longer-term urban space that emerges spontaneously in an attempt by the residents to improve their community. It was observed that the planning of open and public spaces was not a priority for the governments and the other stakeholders involved in settlement design. Despite these compromises, this study reveals that resettled communities appreciate any available open spaces and transform these spaces to accommodate their needs and cultural preferences reflecting their vital role as urban elements for convergence of the multiple sociocultural activities towards the recovery and revitalization of the disaster-affected communities.

The Urban Planning Region of Chung-Hsing New Village is 7.0 magnitude earthquake area and the researched subject of this study. The reasons of the building collapses in the earthquake disaster can be induced by relative bibliographies and investigation data of collapses of the buildings in fields in reference units at 921 earthquake time. The model variables are chosen by considering the feasibility of the data which are obtained and investigated in fields. A forecast model about the damage of the middle and lower floor buildings in earthquake disaster is established by logistic regression of binary regression method. The model is through the coefficient test, the expected sign, the test of significance and the precise rate of the model, to understand the significance of the model coefficient and the application to the strategy. https://www.scientific.net/AMM.204-208.2623.pdf	[Chen, Kuan-Wei] Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Dept Tourism Management, 60,Sec 1,Erren Rd, Tainan 71710, Taiwan; [Tu, Chien-Hung] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Chang, Jung-Nan] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Chang, Jung-Nan] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Inst Civil Engn, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Chen, Jung-Wei] Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Inst Hot Spring Ind, Tainan 71710, Taiwan		Chen, KW (autor correspondente), Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Dept Tourism Management, 60,Sec 1,Erren Rd, Tainan 71710, Taiwan.	ckw0814@mail.chna.edu.tw; hung6563@gmail.com; t0910715493@yahoo.com.tw; cjw2623@mail.chna.edu.tw						Alvanitopoulos PF, 2010, MEASUREMENT, V43, P797, DOI 10.1016/j.measurement.2010.02.011; Chen L.-Q., 1994, EVALUATION URBAN IND; Gao J.-F., 1995, DISASTER PREVENTION; Jin G.-L., 1985, ARCHITECTURAL SCI, V1, P62; Tsou K.-W., 2006, J HOUSING STUDIES, V15, P21; Tu CH, 2009, WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR, V120, P537, DOI 10.2495/SDP090502; Tu C.-H., 2011, STUDY EVALUATION MOD; Yang Y.-C., 1982, EARTHQUAKE ENG ENG S, V5, P3	8	0	0	0	5	TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD	DURNTEN-ZURICH	KREUZSTRASSE 10, 8635 DURNTEN-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND	1660-9336		978-3-03785-484-6	APPL MECH MATER			2012	204-208		1-5				2623	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.204-208.2623	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.204-208.2623			2	Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BEZ11					2022-07-12	WOS:000318817501116

Measuring the Impact of Transportation Diversity on Disaster Resilience in Urban Communities: Case Study of Hurricane Harvey in Houston, TX	COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2019: SMART CITIES, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE)	JUN 17-19, 2019	Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GEORGIA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Comp Div, Amer Soc Civil Engineers	Georgia Inst Technol		NETWORK; BIODIVERSITY	The transportation system in urban areas plays a critical role in evacuation and resource supply during disasters. Transportation diversity, i.e., the availability and distribution of transportation modes across a community, impacts the mode complementarity, which can affect population movements and connectivity among spatial units-especially during extreme events when a failure in one mode can be compensated by other modes. However, few quantitative efforts have explored the impact of physical infrastructure configurations, and more specifically transportation diversity, on urban mobility and connectivity in an actual disaster context. In this paper, we measure transportation diversity with two factors-functional richness and functional evenness translated from the concept of diversity in ecological systems. Disaster resilience is regarded as a dynamic process pre, during, and post disaster in distinct communities and is tracked and quantified based on geospatial Twitter data of population cross-ZIP code tabulation areas movements with an ecology-inspired method-Fisher information-over time. Specifically, we compared the resilience of different neighborhoods in the city of Houston in Hurricane Harvey and found that neighborhoods with a higher level of transportation diversity demonstrated higher resiliency in their mobility during and after the hurricane. This study contributes to understanding how the availability and distribution of transportation infrastructure can impact the disaster resilience of human-infrastructure systems in urban areas. The results can improve transportation design and future urban planning, especially in the context of climate change and natural hazards.

Conservation of Wetlands and Other Coastal Ecosystems: a Commentary on their Value to Protect Biodiversity, Reduce Disaster Impacts, and Promote Human Health and Well-Being	WETLANDS			English	Article						Green & blue space; Natural and nature-based infrastructure; Disaster planning, response and recovery; Urban planning and land-use; Human health	MENTAL-HEALTH; PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS; BLUE SPACE; OIL-SPILLS; EXPOSURE; GREEN; SERVICES; WATER; OPPORTUNITIES; PRESCRIPTION	There is substantial, growing literature that details positive human health effects, psychological and physiological, of exposure to "nature," including "green" and "blue space," with evidence suggesting that diversity of species or environments may have specific positive human health benefits. These health benefits are important ecosystem services provided by healthy ecosystems. In this paper, we discuss several critical ecosystem services provided by wetlands including disaster risk reduction, with an emphasis on benefits to human health and well-being. Impacts to human health via damage to ecosystem services from disasters have rarely been considered in disaster planning or mitigation, nor have the health benefits been part of the framework for planning urban greenspaces and land-use. Coastal wetlands can be part of "natural and nature-based" solutions, minimizing the impacts of disasters by buffering coastal communities from storms and erosion and absorbing flood waters. In addition, mental and physical health benefits of experiencing healthy wetlands could offset some stress and disease encounters related to disasters. Thus, coastal wetlands should be part of a strategy for reducing the risk posed by disasters and facilitating recovery. We conclude with recommendations for research priorities and specific inclusion of wetlands in coastal community planning for disaster response and recovery.

J	Wei, N; Sun, X; Bi, X; Wang, JM; Li, XX				Wei, Na; Sun, Xian; Bi, Xu; Wang, Juan-Min; Li, Xuxiang			The spatial characteristics of precipitation and water-logging disaster during rainy season for urban planning in Xi'an	INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						City precipitation; Water-logging disaster; City planning; Urbanization; Spatial distribution; Disaster management		This paper provides a spatial distribution characteristic of precipitation and water-logging disaster in Xi'an based on hourly precipitation at 23 automatic meteorological observatory stations and water-logging information from 2009 to 2015. The overall spatial distribution of precipitation and intensity is higher and stronger in the north and south of the city but weaker and less in the east and west. The peak precipitation in the south and north appears at 18:00, while in the north also at 20:00-21:00. There is no obvious diurnal variation in the precipitation in the east and west, and higher precipitation frequency was recorded in the east. The water-logging frequency is highest in the Baqiao District, but the water-logged area and depth are smaller and shallower. The water-logged areas are largest in Yanta, Xinchen and Beilin Districts, where frequency is less and the water are shallow. There are more water-logged sites in Lianhu and Weiyang Districts than in other regions. Precipitation intensity and underlying surface properties are the main two factors for water-logging. By using Shanghai Urban Flooding Assessment Model, the area, depth and location of water-logging were simulated through inputting the different magnitude hourly precipitation. The guidance information provided by this paper could help city planning to provide a long-term water-logging disaster management in Xi'an.

J	Clouse, C; Lamb, Z				Clouse, Carey; Lamb, Zachary			The Batture Effect	LANDSCAPE JOURNAL			English	Article						Batture; New Orleans; levee; Mississippi River; informal settlement		On a narrow strip of land between the Mississippi River and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' flood control levees in New Orleans, a squatters' community called the Batture exhibits an unusual inversion of conventional assumptions regarding hazard awareness and development security. For a New Orleanian to willingly take up residence on the "wrong side" of the levee is to break the most fundamental rule of the city's spatial economy and collective psychology. This article proposes the existence of a Batture Effect, a mode of insurgent citizenship whereby hidden environmental threats are made visible and small-scale architectural, urban, and psychological adaptation measures are tested. As an adaptive design strategy, organic in its development over time and responsive to the immediate needs of residents, the occupation of the Batture demonstrates a homesteader's approach to land appropriation. In calling into question land-use and ownership, the urban planning process and its associated spatial agency, and the role of the individual in disaster preparedness, this guerilla urbanism suggests relevant lessons to the practice of landscape architecture and urban planning.

J	Lunecke, MGH				Herrmann Lunecke, Marie Geraldine			Urban planning and tsunami impact mitigation in Chile after February 27, 2010	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Tsunami; Urban planning; Tsunami impact mitigation; Resilience; Chile		Urban and regional planning can and should be a crucial tool to mitigate the potentially devastating effects of a tsunami. This article analyzes the role of urban planning in mitigating the impact of tsunami in Chile, specifically in reaction to the Cobquecura tsunami of February 27, 2010. First, it examines the draft regulations and policies to reduce the impact of tsunami proposed at the national level in response to the 2010 socio-natural disaster. Then, it analyzes in detail tsunami mitigation measures developed at the local level in recent reconstruction plans for coastal towns and villages in the Regin del Maule and Regin del Bio Bio, based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaires realized with local and regional actors during 2011 and 2012. This article shows that there is a lack of guidance at the national level to mitigate the impact of tsunami and that mitigation policies are being developed mainly at the local level through non-binding coastal reconstruction plans, which focus strongly on "anti-tsunami" engineering solutions. Other available planning tools such as risk zone planning or relocation of housing and critical infrastructure have only been proposed in a few coastal reconstruction plans without adequate instruments for their implementation and lacking an active participation of citizens. Hence, a clear regulatory framework and set of urban policies is urgently required in Chile at the national and local level to reduce its vulnerability to tsunami.

Whereas some progress appears to have been made in reducing mortality from disaster events in recent years, the economic consequences of disasters have significantly risen. A number of factors contribute to this: the increasing concentration of people and assets in cities, the tendency for cities to be situated in lowlying coastal areas and on the banks of major rivers, the extension of supply networks and the increased dependence on all kinds of networks which mass urbanization entails. Climate change predictions also suggest that both vulnerabilities of populations and the severity of disaster events are set to increase. The collapse or failure of buildings and infrastructure is often the mechanism by which disasters occur and the economic losses incurred are directly associated with the extent of damage to the built environment. Much can be done by built environment professionals to improve disaster resilience through the incorporation of disaster risk reduction measures in urban planning, in the design and construction of buildings and infrastructure, in responding to disasters and in reconstruction after disasters. These all call for additional investment in the built environment and, although the current magnitude of disaster-related losses suggests that such investments in mitigation would be worthwhile, there appears to be a lack of suitable financing mechanisms available to enable them. This paper reports the results of a desktop study into financing mechanisms for disaster risk reduction investments in the built environment. The aim of this initial study is to define and understand financing mechanisms and their applicability to potential investors and their specific contexts. A Facet Theory approach to defining and understanding the problem domain is adopted and the paper elaborates a mapping sentence that describes the ranges of financing mechanisms, investors and disaster contexts that need to be taken into consideration as a first step to gain a comprehensive understanding of financing mechanisms and their applicability.

Studying the numerical simulation method of the urban rainstorm floods is helpful for disaster prevention and mitigation. In this paper, an urban flood simulation model is established based on a plain flood simulation model. Many improvements have been made, including modeling methods of the buildings, rainfall and drainage system. An area in Beijing was selected as the study area. The method is compared with a non-hydrodynamics flood simulation method. Different rainstorm scenarios are simulated and compared. The effects of the drainage wells are also tested for urban planning.

Climate Change, Environmental Disasters, and Health Inequities: The Underlying Role of Structural Inequalities	CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS			English	Article						Environmental disasters; Health inequities; Structural inequality; Climate change; Environmental justice	PUBLIC-HEALTH; LAND-USE; GENTRIFICATION; DISPARITIES; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT; DISCRIMINATION; VULNERABILITY; SEGREGATION; JUSTICE	Purpose of Review We review and analyze recent literature in public health, urban planning, and disaster management to better understand the relationships between climate change, natural disasters, and root causes of health disparities in the USA. Recent Findings Existing scholarship establishes clear linkages between climate change and increasing occurrences and severity of natural disasters across the USA. The frequency and types of disasters vary by region and impact both short and long-term health outcomes. Current research highlights health inequities affecting lower income and minoritized communities disproportionately, but data-driven studies critically examining the role of structural inequalities in climate-induced health disparities are sparse. Adding to the body of knowledge, our conceptual framework maps how long-standing structural inequalities in policy, practice, and funding shape vulnerability of lower-income, racially and ethnically marginalized individuals. Vulnerability follows three common pathways: disparities in "exposure", "sensitivity", and "resiliency" before, during, and after a climate disaster. We recommend that future research, policy, and practice shift towards solutions that unearth and address the structural biases that cause environmental disaster and health inequities.

With urban development and people's living standard increasingly improved, it become increasingly obvious that the city's earthquake disaster reduction function is relatively backward. After the disastrous earthquake, victims' life can be easy and secondary disasters can be avoided by planning and constructing the indoor earthquake shelters with the capacity against the strong earthquake. Since there are, at present, no relevant standards and regulations established by the state about the indoor earthquake shelters, it is necessary to carry out the technical study of indoor earthquake shelters to provide theoretical support and reference for future relevant regulations to be promulgated by the states. This paper firstly investigates the victims' life after the destructive earthquake abroad and at home, secondly summarizes the lessons from the recent destructive earthquake disasters and points out the key points of the indoor earthquake shelter's planning in cities and towns, and then proposes the definition and function requirements of indoor earthquake shelters based on earthquake shelters studies of the domestic and the international.

Flood resilience assessment was performed based on a multi-criteria decision-making approach or the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) of pairwise comparison. The results indicate that runoff is considered the most influential factor in flood hazards, followed by land use, rainfall, and historical flood events, sequentially. Regarding the flood incident management concept, a questionnaire survey (n = 552) was conducted to understand the impacts of flood on local communities. The findings reveal that 50% of respondents had never received any flood information or participated in training sessions on flood preparedness. Most reported their concerns about the inadequate supply of drinking water during a flood. Spearman's correlation coefficient shows positive correlations between flood disaster relief payments, preparedness training, access to flood hazard mapping, emergency health services, and their flood preparation actions. According to the modified UNDRR indicators, the top three highest AHP values in building community resilience to flood hazards in Ayutthaya are flood risk scenario identification, the effectiveness of emergency flood disaster response, integrated urban planning, and disaster risk reduction. The policy implications of this research include the need for national authorities to better understand the role cities can play a vital role in supporting both national and international climate resilience frameworks, especially Thailand's National Disaster Management Plan, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), and the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Building on and around hilly areas in many regions has increased, and it poses a severe threat to the physical infrastructure and people living within such zones. Quantitative assessment of social vulnerability in Malaysia is worrying because it has been given less attention than hazard-related studies. Therefore, this study's objective is to find out the indicators used for social vulnerability assessment in the context of a landslide in Malaysia. The analysis is critical for understanding the measures of social vulnerability, given that the incorporation of climate change and disaster risk mitigation issues in urban planning and management are considered priorities in ensuring a stable population growth and avoiding economic disruption. A systematic study on the Scopus and Web of Science repositories was conducted based on the PRISMA Report analysis method. This article concluded that there are six important indicators of social vulnerability in the context of landslide in Malaysia.

Total, exportation of Denizli is USD 2.6 billion. Denizli is faced with serious risk of damage due to its big industrial enterprises that have industrial potential. There is a possibility of recurrence of fault lines, which destroyed magnificent earthquakes in ancient historical cities and had a big source of earthquakes. Because, as the region has active seismic fault lines and strains which are on more accumulate day by day. Moreover, the Majority of industrial enterprises in Denizli is prefabricated. Unfortunately, scientists say that these structures are dangerous. Denizli has experiences on management change in this period. City removes from the entire population which is above 500 thousands metropolitan city to management. So as city management, population exceeds one million and it has great structure compared to earlier. Correspondingly, the city gains more different dimension on disaster management. Factors in available locations of metropolitan management and disaster management do not match up with possibilities. In conclusion, fires, explosions which may take place in industrial enterprises in Denizli require the planning of emergency action and fire brigade placement tools, a new element of disaster.

However, successful integration, and thus the implementation of integrated planning measures, is difficult in practice. To understand and reduce the problems encountered, it is important to investigate systemic challenges. These challenges are rooted in the interaction between various stakeholders that affect DRM and the integration of CCA, directly or indirectly. This study explores the degree of integration in on-the-ground measures by studying systemic challenges, using the Nicaraguan DRM system as a case study. A theoretical framework for investigating systemic challenges in DRM systems was developed. It was then used in a retrospective analysis of the different functions of the systems in order to identify fragmentation in knowledge, information and coordination flows at local and national levels of governance. The results revealed several fragmented processes and functions in the Nicaraguan DRM system. These lead to difficulties in consolidating relevant information produced by multiple governmental authorities at different levels, and transferring this information to the local level. Fragmentation also leads, in turn, to little integration of CCA aspects into DRM in both local planning and practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tumini, I; Villagra-Islas, P; Herrmann-Lunecke, G				Tumini, Irina; Villagra-Islas, Paula; Herrmann-Lunecke, Geraldine			Evaluating reconstruction effects on urban resilience: a comparison between two Chilean tsunami-prone cities	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Post-disaster reconstruction; Urban resilience; Urban morphology indicators; Earthquake; Tsunami	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; VULNERABILITY; EARTHQUAKE; CAPACITY; CLIMATE; DESIGN	Facing natural disasters is a priority challenge for cities, exacerbated by increases in urban population and climate change. Improving the resilience of cities is a critical need for the international community and especially for territories exposed to multiple risks, such as Chile. Although disasters are always tragic, the recovery and reconstruction post-disaster may provide a unique opportunity to prevent future suffering, enhancing the resilience of local communities. This paper presents the analysis of two Chilean reconstruction programmes applied in Mehuin and Dichato, after the earthquake and tsunami of 22 May 1960 and 27 February 2010, respectively. In both cases, reconstruction programmes were supported by the Chilean Government, but using different approaches: one focused on providing housing for people injured in the earthquake, while the other also included urban amenities and services. This article proposes an urban morphology analysis framework; in addition, it presents the assessment of the two case studies before and after a disaster, thus evaluating their resilience. By comparing urban morphology resilience pre- and post-disaster, a discussion about the effectiveness of two reconstruction approaches is presented. Finally, conclusions and recommendations to better integrate resilience into urban planning are proposed, with the aim of opening the discussion about how to make cities more resilient to natural disasters.

J	Parthasarathy, D				Parthasarathy, D.			Informality, Resilience, and the Political Implications of Disaster Governance	PACIFIC AFFAIRS			English	Article						informality; disaster governance; resilience; urban flooding; disaster mitigation	URBAN; MARKETS; STATES; MUMBAI	Informal sector actors played a key role in Mumbai's resilience to disastrous floods in 2005. Members of small-scale retail and service-sector businesses, the city's underclass, its waste workers and scrap dealers, and sundry individual tradespersons such as electricians, plumbers, masons, and sanitary workers were at the heart of recovery and rehabilitation in the weeks following the floods of July 2005. These floods not only affected significant parts of the city's new Central Business District (CBD) and business sectors but also its poor and marginalized communities that lived in environmentally fragile and marginal locations. Ironically, these actors have also been at the receiving end of distorted urban planning initiatives, real estate growth, bourgeois environmentalism-inspired middle-class activism, and ethnic chauvinist political forces, which have pushed them to the city's social, economic, and spatial margins. Hence,the aforementioned reasons have made the lives and livelihoods of these actors quite precarious and insecure. Going with recent sociological attempts to bridge the expanding field of disaster studies and classical sociological theorization by linking development theories to the study of disasters and their social implications, this paper argues for more imaginative disaster mitigation and management strategies that recognize the role of informal sector workers in post-disaster resilience. It is argued that this recognition should be accompanied by formal state-sponsored institutional inclusion and integration of informal sector Workers and actors in disaster governance. In Mumbai, informal economic actors were characterized by resourcefulness, access to key networks in enabling recovery, flexibility and innovativeness in design and planning, and the ability to offer low-cost options which could be rapidly deployed. These tend to contrast with the slowness and cumbersome procedures and responses that typify formal state and private responses to disasters. Given the feeble response mechanisms of state institutions in disaster management and mitigation in much of the developing world, and the established fact of citizen action being the first to respond to disaster situations, this paper suggests that paying attention to and involving informal sector actors in disaster governance can both augment the quality of disaster management and enhance the possibility of greater integration of the city's marginalized and excluded groups into its mainstream social fabric.

The study focused on an area in Central Java, Indonesia, surrounded by four active volcanic mountains, and explored the economic, environmental and social vulnerability associated with the site. Although initially the study focused on drawing up and improving the relocation plan, it was soon discovered that eliminating environmental vulnerability by relocating residents to new sites may in fact increase their economic vulnerability. This led the study to embrace the concept of living in harmony with disaster. In conclusion, the results of the study are discussed in terms recognizing environmental hazards as a vehicle for understanding local perceptions, and utilizing these perceptions to suggest mitigation measures that are more responsive to the site at risk.

J	Jordan, E; Javernick-Will, A				Jordan, Elizabeth; Javernick-Will, Amy			Indicators of Community Recovery: Content Analysis and Delphi Approach	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article						Disaster recovery; Indicators; Content analysis; Delphi method	DISASTER; VULNERABILITY	Disaster recovery has been studied from a variety of perspectives including the fields of sociology, engineering, policy implementation, political-ecology, systems theory, geography, and urban planning, leading to a wide variety of definitions and indicators for measuring recovery. To assess what indicators can be used to measure both predisaster resilience and postdisaster recovery, an in-depth content analysis of recovery indicators in the existing literature was performed. Articles from 2000 to 2010 in four disaster-focused journals that include perspectives of engineers, social scientists, practitioners, and economists were analyzed. Articles were selected by a keyword search and analyzed for recovery indicators using an emergent coding scheme. Interestingly, many research articles never defined recovery. Recovery indicators were categorized as social, economic, environmental, and infrastructural. The indicators cited were analyzed based on the disciplinary affiliation of the author. Authors from different disciplines cited different indicators, suggesting that increased interdisciplinary collaboration may be needed. As a second step in this research, a multiround Delphi survey was used to obtain expert opinion on the recovery indicators. This process verified that the set of indicators identified through the content analysis were important and provided a rating of the importance of each indicator. Panelists also provided justifications for any ratings that differed from the median. Researchers can use these results as indicators of recovery in future studies. Similarly, practitioners will be able to use the condensed opinions of experts in the field of disaster recovery and planning. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000087.

J	Jacobs, F				Jacobs, Fayola			Black feminism and radical planning: New directions for disaster planning research	PLANNING THEORY			English	Article						Black feminism; disasters; environmental justice; feminism; social vulnerability; urban planning	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; HAZARD EXPOSURE; RECOVERY; MITIGATION; RESILIENCE; RACISM	After Hurricane Katrina's devastation of the United States' Gulf Coast, conversations about flooding became focused on the interconnections between so-called "natural" disasters, poverty, gender and race. Although research has long shown that women, people of color and low-income communities are more vulnerable to natural hazards, the disproportionate effects of Hurricane Katrina and subsequent federal and state disaster response efforts forced the national spotlight on the institutional and systemic nature of racism, classism and sexism. Using Black feminism and radical planning theory, two lenses that provides a comprehensive framework for understanding racism, classism and sexism, this article examines the concept and literature of social vulnerability. I argue while social vulnerability research has made significant contributions to planners' understandings of disasters and inequity, it fails to center community knowledge, identify intersectional oppressions and name them as such and encourage community activism, all of which are keys to making meaningful change.

The underestimated role of the transportation network: Improving disaster & community resilience	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Resilience; Transport networks; Equity; Accessibility; Urban planning; Natural hazards	ROAD NETWORK; ACCESSIBILITY; VULNERABILITY; IMPACT; FRAGILITY; DAMAGE; PERFORMANCE; RECOVERY; ENHANCE; EQUITY	Improving community resilience relies on our ability to evaluate and understand the direct and indirect role of the transportation network. This requires losing our fixation with network functionality in favour of an approach that evaluates whether the network is truly serving the community's needs. In this paper, we present such an approach. With the understanding that sufficient and equitable access to amenities is key to community resilience, we leverage open source data and routing algorithms to simulate road and service closures under various hazard scenarios. Among our methodological contributions is the ability to efficiently modify entire transportation networks to reflect hazard damage and identify isolated communities. This makes integrating hazard simulation with access and equity evaluations practicable on a large scale. We illustrate this approach in three cities. Ultimately, a broader view of the transportation network's role will better support communities prepare for and respond equitably when a disaster occurs.	[Anderson, M. J.; Kiddle, D. A. F.; Logan, T.

To do so, we focus on a series of fires that devastated Park Yard Market in Kampala, Uganda, one of the largest retail spaces in East Africa. Officially accidental, rumours suggest the fires were deliberately set to displace traders and make way for the lucrative (re)development of the city-centre land. Concerned less with the veracity of these rumours and more with their political ecologies, we show how narratives of Park Yard forwarded by the state and private interests indeed readied it for disaster. Here, we trace how colonial narratives of urban planning in the city, driven by technocratic imperatives of improvement, modernisation, and safety echo in the contemporary devaluation of Park Yard and its women traders. Against this, we show how the caring labour and investment by those traders was central to the formation and maintenance of the market. Over time they created an economically viable space, even as their work was devalued and legally unrecognised. Our analysis interrogates the colonial past-presents and the gendered-racialised logics of neoliberal urban development. This framing understands spectacular disaster, a series of highly destructive fires, as inextricably connected to historically produced systems of precarious urban marginality. It demonstrates the uneven impacts, and in particular the deeply deleterious impacts for low-income Ugandan women; the relationship between fire disaster, vulnerability, and the labour of social reproduction; and the varied ways female traders resisted, adapted, and struggled to defend their economic space in the city. Specifically, a feminist political ecology also helps us understand the embodied nature of this relationship. That is, it is always produced through emotion-laden, material, and corporeal gendered, racialised and classed power and both relies on and violates particular kinds of idealised or disposable urban subjectivities.

The approach is a simplified catastrophe risk assessment, to calculate the direct costs of storm surges under scenarios of sea level rise, coupled to an economic input-output (IO) model. The output is a risk assessment of the direct and indirect economic impacts of storm surge under climate change, including, for example, production and job losses and reconstruction duration, and the benefits of investment in upgraded sea defences. The simplified catastrophe risk assessment entails a statistical analysis of storm surge characteristics, geographical-information analysis of population and asset exposure combined with aggregated vulnerability information. For the city of Copenhagen, it is found that in absence of adaptation, sea level rise would significantly increase flood risks. Results call for the introduction of adaptation in long-term urban planning, as one part of a comprehensive strategy to manage the implications of climate change in the city. Mitigation policies can also aid adaptation by limiting the pace of future sea level rise.

At same time it accelerates the city society, economy and environment evaluation harmoniously and continually. External environmental factors have a significant influence on our study. They are known as PEST (political, economical, social and technical factors). And the integrated environment analysis is named general land suitability evaluation system in this paper. Because of so many and differ in thousands factors, nowadays, we have no a set of integral factors and uniform estimate system. In this paper, the set of estimate factors are considered involving the natural factors, the entironmental factors, the policy factors, and economical factors. So the set of estimate factors is called general land suitability evaluation factor system. In this paper, based on GIS technique, an instance of Ximni general planning is used to validate the influence caused by geo-hazards to land suitability evaluation, and the loss caused by geo-hazards when disaster happens. From the estimate result, It is believed that the system can direct the city I land suitability evaluation and ascertain further general planning strategy distribution.

The subjective and objective weighting methods are adopted to analyze the weights of these factors. Weight analysis lays the foundation for the establishment of evaluation model and provides scientific and reasonable evidences for establishing the "feasibility and appropriateness of underground development of municipal public facilities" evaluation system and the resolutions of the underground development of municipal public facilities.

In order to balance the relations between urban development and river eco-environmental protection, avoid reappearance of mega rainstorm disaster like the one on July 21st in Beijing, we suggest protecting and safeguarding the structure and function of urban river ecological system from perspectives of urban planning, eco-environment improvement and integrated management over urban river system.

We discuss the climatology of Texas hurricanes by analyzing the spatial and temporal patterns and some aspects of factors that contribute to their observed variability. Finally, we construct scenarios of historic hurricanes that formed and made landfall rapidly on the Texas coastline and suggest that these storms are especially challenging for emergency planners, citizens, and public officials.

J	Imani, M; Fakour, H; Lo, SL				Imani, Moslem; Fakour, Hoda; Lo, Shang-Lien			Exploring Climate Disaster Resilience: Insight into City and Zone Levels of Southern Taiwan	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						climate disaster resilience; resilient city; Southern Taiwan; zone level		While climate change is one of the greatest environmental threats the entire world faces today, rapid urbanization is making both the community and ecosystem more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Estimating urban resilience is thus one of the important processes to understanding the current and potential future risks of cities providing practical policies and qualified strategies to cope with climate change effects. This study presents a disaster risk analysis in Southern Taiwan at the municipal and zone levels using the Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI). The index was estimated at both the zone and city scale of three coastal cities, namely Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung. The CDRI approach consists of five different dimensions (physical, social, economic, institutional, and natural), with several parameters and variables reflecting the abilities, strength, and threats of case study cities to cope with potential climate-related disasters. The findings show that, while the physical dimension has the highest resilience among cities, the lowest average scores and the least resilience belong to the natural dimension. The overall CDRI score for different cites also revealed various capabilities, shortcomings, drawbacks, and potential risks of neighbored cities in the same region. It is expected that the findings of this study shall serve as an urban planning tool to recognize the sectors within an urban context that are more or less resilient, enhance actions at the local level, and support future planning decisions.

A better understanding of the influence of urban land-use patterns on water-logging will be helpful for enhancing urban flood resistance. The relationship between the characteristics of land-use patterns and the risk of urban water-logging and flood disaster (UWLFD) was analyzed in this paper, using landscape pattern indicators to describe the land-use structure. These included patch density (PD), edge density (ED), landscape division index (DIVISION), contagion (CONTAG), Shannon's evenness index (SHEI), and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). The risk of UWLFD was measured using the topographic slope and urban surface cover. Based on GIS and remote sensing data in 2003 and 2013, a case study of the metropolitan region of Kunming City showed that the risk of UWLFD had a positive correlation with landscape fragmentation (e.g., PD and ED), and strong negative correlation with landscape contagion (e.g., CONTAG) during the study period. This implied that landscape fragmentation aggravated the risk of UWLFD while landscape connectivity reduced the risk. Measures such as unified and long-term urban planning and design and the construction of green infrastructure will reduce the risk of UWLFD. The relationship between the landscape pattern and the risk of UWLFD provides a new perspective for systematic urban planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sritarapipat, T; Takeuchi, W				Sritarapipat, Tanakorn; Takeuchi, Wataru			Land Cover Change Simulations in Yangon Under Several Scenarios of Flood and Earthquake Vulnerabilities with Master Plan	JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH			English	Article						prediction of urban expansion; disaster risk assessment; disaster risk reduction; Landsat	HAZARD	Yangon is the largest city and major economic area in Myanmar. However, it is considered to have a high risk of floods and earthquakes. In order to mitigate future flood and earthquake damage in Yangon, land cover change simulations considering flood and earthquake vulnerabilities are needed to support urban planning and management. This paper proposes land cover change simulations in Yangon from 2020 to 2040 under various scenarios of flood and earthquake vulnerabilities with a master plan. In our methodology, we used a dynamic statistical model to predict urban expansion in Yangon from 2020 to 2040. We employed a master plan as the future dataset to enhance the prediction of urban expansion. We applied flood and earthquake vulnerabilities based on multi-criteria analysis as the areas vulnerable to disaster. We simulated land cover changes from 2020 to 2040 considering the vulnerable areas with a master plan for multiple scenarios. The experiments indicated that by using a master plan, some of the predicted urban areas are still located in areas highly vulnerable to floods and earthquakes. By integrating the prediction of urban expansion with flood and earthquake vulnerabilities, the predicted urban areas can effectively avoid areas highly vulnerable to floods and earthquakes.

J	Jeong, S; Yoon, DK				Jeong, Seunghoo; Yoon, D. K.			Examining Vulnerability Factors to Natural Disasters with a Spatial Autoregressive Model: The Case of South Korea	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						natural disasters; vulnerability; spatial autoregressive model (SAM); South Korea	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; HAZARDS; FLOOD; TEXAS; IMPACT; CHINA; POPULATION; FLORIDA	Socially and economically marginalized people and environmentally vulnerable areas are disproportionately affected by natural hazards. Identifying populations and places vulnerable to disasters is important for disaster management, and crucial for mitigating their economic consequences. From the fields of geography, emergency management, and urban planning, several approaches and methodologies have been used to identify significant vulnerability factors affecting the incidence and impact of disasters. This study performs a regression analysis to examine several factors associated with disaster damage in 230 local communities in South Korea, using ten vulnerability indicators for social, economic, and environmental aspects, and a single indicator for disaster characteristics. A Lagrange Multiplier diagnostic test-based spatial autoregressive model (SAM) was applied to assess the potential spatial autocorrelation in the ordinary least squares (OLS) residuals. This study compared the OLS regression results with those of a spatial autoregressive model, for both presence of spatial autocorrelation, and model performance. The conclusion of this study is that Korean communities with a higher vulnerability to disasters, as a result of their socioeconomic and environmental characteristics, are more likely to experience economic losses from natural disasters.

Based on the hypothesis that the consequences of natural disaster would be an opportunity for a territory to build back better, this study aims to understand the recovery trajectory that is underway on the island of Saint Martin 2 years after Hurricane Irma. Our analysis of Saint Martin's recovery from natural hazards is based on three factors: (1) the historical context and the evolution of building construction over the past 70 years; (2) the organization of local and national authorities; (3) the perception of the situation by the population. This original interdisciplinary approach of the post-disaster recovery phase provides a better understanding of the complexity of this period. The results of this study and the cross-analysis of these three methods highlight the causal links between the governance of the reconstruction, the psycho-sociological recovery of the disaster victims, and the history of the urbanization of an island exposed to natural hazards.

Therefore, urban physical growth needs to be monitored to prevent built-up areas from expanding into hazard zones. This study analyzed the dynamics of urban physical growth and its driving forces in tsunami-affected areas of Banda Aceh after the 2004 tsunami. Built-up areas were extracted from Landsat images. The annual growth rate equation was used to estimate the growth characteristics in the tsunami-affected and safe areas. In-depth interviews and extensive literature reviews were also conducted to identify the determinant factors of urban redevelopment in tsunami-affected areas. Results showed that the annual growth rate was high in the areas during the disaster recovery period (2005-2009). Nevertheless, urban physical growth dominated in the safe areas during 2009-2019. The study also identified several driving forces of urban physical growth in the hazard zones: (1) population growth, (2) spatial planning, (3) distance to old city center, (4) land ownership and prices, and (5) socio-economic factors. This study provided new insights for urban planners to reduce disaster risk in urban areas.

J	Kammerbauer, M; Wamsler, C				Kammerbauer, Mark; Wamsler, Christine			Social inequality and marginalization in post-disaster recovery: Challenging the consensus?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Disaster recovery; Disaster insurance; Facilitation; Housing rehabilitation; Inequality; Marginalization; Reconstruction; Resilience; Risk governance; Urban planning	DISASTER RISK; RESILIENCE; ADAPTATION; CITIES	Disasters and subsequent recovery efforts often reinforce social inequality and marginalization, hampering sustainable development paths. This paper presents an analysis of inequality and marginalization effects of post-disaster reconstruction from a risk governance perspective. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examine the Fischerdorf and Natternberg districts of the German city of Deggendorf, severely affected by the 2013 floods in Europe. The findings show that social inequality and marginalization affected housing reconstruction (and vice versa) in unexpected ways. Uninsured groups (such as the elderly and migrant homeowners) received prompt, ad-hoc support from state and civil society actors, while insured homeowners (mostly higher-income groups) experienced ongoing disputes between state and market actors that hampered their recovery. Some marginalized groups could not access state support, as various aspects of cultural diversity were not adequately considered. This fostered, and created new, patterns of inequality and risk. The ad-hoc engagement of civil society was crucial, but insufficient, to fully buffer the effects of inequality and marginalization resulting from formal recovery processes. We conclude that it is critical to give more attention to the interplay, and power constellations, between state, market and civil society actors to facilitate sustainable recovery and development-by counteracting potential inequality and marginalization effects. Increased consideration of cultural diversity and the support of citizens who play dual roles (and can mediate between different actors) was identified to be vital in this context. We thus call for increased research into the issue of complementary city-citizen rights and responsibilities in risk reduction and adaptation planning.

As the transportation infrastructure of large cities develops with high speed and intelligence, more attention will be paid to its safety. The main cause of death in subway fires is asphyxiation, due to the closed specificity of the underground space. Therefore, smoke exhaust facilities should be capable of minimizing the effects of smoke to ensure the safe evacuation of passengers in the event of fire. In this study, three kinds of fire locations are adopted to analyze the distribution of platform temperature, CO, and visibility in connection with the smoke exhaust system operation method. We evaluate the performance of the applicable smoke exhaust system from ASET-based untenable area analysis. Fatality evaluation by escape analysis according to the smoke exhaust system estimates the fatality based on the tenability performance evaluation. Moreover, the FED method was used to evaluate tenability performance. Therefore, the result of this study suggests a solution for sustainable subway Disaster response from the performance evaluation of the subway platform smoke exhaust system for safe evacuation of passengers, which is essential for subway construction or remodeling.

J	Shao, J; Yan, HH; Xu, HS				Shao, Jun; Yan, Huihui; Xu, Haosheng			Planning Research on Application of Nanomaterial Technology in Disaster Prevention and Reconstruction	JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							BEAM-COLUMN JOINTS; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; NANOSILICA; CONCRETE; CEMENT	An earthquake causes a huge loss of life and property. After an earthquake, many buildings are seriously damaged or collapsed. On the one hand, it is necessary to make full use of nanomaterials technology to improve seismic strength during reconstruction; on the other hand, scientific planning is needed to reduce pollution, carbon emissions, and energy consumption. This paper mainly studies the application of nanomaterial technology in disaster prevention and reconstruction. Through a series of planning safeguard measures, the overall seismic performance of the city is improved in order to provide theoretical guidance and technical support for disaster prevention and reconstruction. This paper mainly introduces the stress analysis of frame joints after earthquake and the planning of urban disaster prevention and reconstruction. In addition to the different types of concrete materials (ordinary concrete, nano silica fiber concrete, PVA fiber concrete), the fixed amount of water, superplasticizer, reinforcement, sand, and gravel, the concrete strength grade is C30. Then, three kinds of concrete frame joints are tested under low cycle cyclic loading to compare the seismic performance of the three kinds of concrete. The experimental results show that the fuzzy evaluation of urban disaster prevention and reconstruction planning has been carried out for 6 communities in this city. Among them, 4 communities are qualified and 2 communities are unqualified. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on seismic reinforcement or carry out urban planning research again. Compared with ordinary concrete, the bearing capacity and ductility coefficient of nano silica fiber concrete and PVA fiber concrete are increased by 37.8% and 15.6%, respectively. It is proved that the seismic performance of nano silica fiber reinforced concrete is far better than that of ordinary concrete.

Province of Potenza has territorial coordination competences over 100 Municipalities and is mostly characterized by all the mayor natural risks whose potential impacts on the community are very serious in case of disasters. For this reason, an important section of the TCP is dedicated to the risk assessment/management and to the mitigation activities as important actions to be performed also at the urban level. An innovative aspect developed in the TCP is the implementation of the "resilience of communities" policy in territorial planning, by introducing risks-mitigation directives and recommendations to be applied to the local and urban planning and strategic actions in order to involve the local actors, the private sector and the community itself in the resilience's implementation processes. The TCP gives some inputs to be followed by the Municipalities in their urban planning activities and Municipalities are asked to demonstrate how the urban planning proposals are resilient. For risks "active" mitigation at local level (namely the "structural" prevention), the Province will contribute - among the national/regional institutional framework - in seeking to promote or facilitate programs of territorial extraordinary maintenance to be implemented by the local governments, through the identification of possible financial mechanisms and procedural facilitation. The resilience process is accompanied by other territorial policy actions acting on the natural and built environment systems, such as strategies for adaptation to climate change and environmental protection, and by the technical, organizational and knowledge support provided to municipalities in the implementation process over the provincial territory.

First, the seven methods of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE), the set pair analysis (SPA), the improved grey target analysis (IGT), the fuzzy stochastic simulation (FSS), the grey relational degree analysis (GRA), the extension matter element evaluation (EME), and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) are used to conduct urban comprehensive disaster risk assessment. Second, to ensure the degree of correlation between individual evaluation methods and make full use of more information to achieve the purpose of complementary advantages, the Kendall synergy coefficient, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and the comprehensive support coefficient are used as the single-method compatibility consistency test standards. The combined evaluation methods of the cyclic correction model and support model are used to combine the single evaluation results, and the highly coordinated comprehensive disaster risk ranking value and evaluation value are obtained through repeated tests, thus constructing a highly scientific and reasonable dual combination evaluation model. Finally, through analysis and comparison of the final combined ranking and evaluation values of 31 provinces, municipalities directly under the central government and autonomous regions in China under the dual combination mode, it is verified that the dual combination idea can obtain evaluation results with high convergence and credibility, solve the problem of inconsistent evaluation results of multiple methods, provide a new research idea and method for measuring the comprehensive disaster risk of cities, and provide a scientific basis for efficiently serving comprehensive risk prevention management and various urban planning and construction work.

J	Hamza, M; Zetter, R				Hamza, M; Zetter, R			Structural adjustment, urban systems, and disaster vulnerability in developing countries	CITIES			English	Editorial Material							ECONOMY; CITIES	Structural adjustment (SA) - or macroeconomic reform - has become a dominant characteristic especially in developing countries, where national economies are being reshaped to a common discipline regardless of local circumstances. Within this context, the paper examines the impact of structural adjustment on disaster vulnerability in the urban sector, through examining some structural considerations which underpin forms of technical guidance to mitigate disasters. The paper argues that urban areas are not disaster prone by nature; rather that the structural processes which accelerate rapid urbanisation, population movement and population concentrations substantially increase the disaster vulnerability of the mass of low-income urban dwellers. Migrants settle on areas either originally unsafe (flood plains, land slides, etc), or create the potential of man made disaster (environmental degradation, slum fires, health hazards). This problem derives from three interrelated factors. First, structural adjustment policies are the driving force generating new coalitions of urban interests responsible for decision making at the national and on the city levels. A potential implication is the trade-off between production, competition and efficiency and adverse environmental consequences in terms of potentially disaster-vulnerable settlements. Such trade-offs, it is argued, cannot be afforded by most developing countries. Second, reinforcing this, is the shift in viewing the city economy in an international context. The future of the city, in a globalising economy, depends on economic imperatives and a new division of labour in which Third World cities provide highly competitive labour markets. This questions whether technical and environmental safety concerns, which land use planning might try to address, have been overtaken by the political, and economic forces in a global context. Third, the transformation in urban systems has led to review of planning processes and methodologies, ie the form and nature of urban planning. This questions how the new tools and mechanisms of planning intervention and urban management can respond to issues such as disaster mitigation. In other words, who will be responsible? The effect of these structural factors influencing urbanisation processes, the paper argues, exacerbates disaster vulnerability in Third World cities. The paper concludes with guidelines as to how negative impacts of SA policies vis-a-vis disaster vulnerability could be minimised. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A high volume of geospatially enabled Tweets can be leveraged to create population curves and/or heatmaps delineated by day of week and hour of day. When making these estimations, it is critical to have adequate data, or the confidence of the estimations will be low. This is especially pertinent to disaster response, where Tweet collection for a new city/town/locale may need to be rapidly deployed. Using previously leveraged data removal methods, temporal data quantity is explored using sets of data from increasingly longer collection periods. When generating these estimates, it is also necessary to identify and mitigate data from automated Twitter bots. This work examines the integration of a modern, web services based, Twitter bot assessment algorithm, executes data removal experiments on collected data, describes the technical architecture, and discusses results/follow-on work.

In the case of the L'Aquila earthquake this risk seems to emerge within the urban planning on two levels of dwelling: at a landscape level, where there has been a change in the shape of the city towards a sprawling-sprinkling process; at an architectural level, on the problematic relationship between the politics and the poetics of cultural heritage protection and the goal to get restoration works capable to ensure the citizens seismic safety.

Despite this fact, urban area of Doboj City did not threatened frequently in the past from landsliding. In the mid of May 2014, heavy rainfall between 250 and 300 mm triggered flood and activated numerous landslides in the area of Doboj City. In the frame of EU recovery program the Study of flood and landslide risk assessment for urban area of Doboj was conducted. The landslide inventory, landslide susceptibility and relative risk assessment for housing sector were done as a support for local communities for better preparedness in the future. The landslide susceptibility map for urban area of Doboj City in scale 1: 5000 has provided useful information for Master Plan and related urban planning documents. Several non-structural and structural measures were proposed as a result of situation analysis and recovery needs. In this paper post landslides disaster and relief activities in the area of Doboj City, Bosnia and Herzegovina are presented.

Use of deep learning models in street-level images to classify one-story unreinforced masonry buildings based on roof diaphragms	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Unreinforced masonry; Diaphragm; Deep learning; Convolutional neural networks; Seismic risk; Risk assessment; Urban planning	SEISMIC RISK-ASSESSMENT	In this paper, we explore the potential of convolutional neural networks to classify street-level imagery of one-story unreinforced masonry buildings (MURs) according to the flexibility of the roof diaphragm (rigid or flexible). This information is critical for vulnerability studies, disaster risk assessments, disaster management strategies, etc., and is of great relevance in cities where unreinforced masonry is the most common building typology or where the majority of the population resides in such buildings. Our contribution could be useful for local governments of cities in developing countries seeking to significantly reduce the number of deaths caused by disasters. Our research results indicate that VGG19 is the convolutional neural network architecture with the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.80, a precision of 0.88, and a recall of 0.84. The results are encouraging and could be used to reduce the amount of resources (both human and economic) for the development of detailed exposure models for unreinforced masonry buildings.

J	Butcher-Gollach, C				Butcher-Gollach, Colleen			Planning, the urban poor and climate change in Small Island Developing States (SIDS): unmitigated disaster or inclusive adaptation?	INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW			English	Article						Caribbean; Pacific; urban poor; slums; climate change adaptation; disaster risk resilience; urban management; planning		This article identifies the impacts of climate change on the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean and the Pacific, which, through their geography and location, are amongst the most vulnerable countries in the world to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. It explores how, in the main, the lack of recognition of the economic imperatives and importance of well-managed cities and urban centres in the SIDS has resulted in national urban planning systems and internationally-funded climate change adaptation and natural risk resilience mitigation 'best practice' interventions that largely ignore the needs of the urban poor living in urban centres - in particular, those in extra-legal settlements. It goes on to posit a different set of interrelated measures based on successful lessons from the field that might circumscribe a more targeted approach to climate change adaptation and to strengthening risk resilience in these small, vulnerable countries, so as to be more inclusive of the poor.

Urban shadow distributions and land surface components are considered as the most influential factors in the thermal radiation of urban environment. This paper proposes a new method to determine the two factors from high-spatial-resolution digital surface models (DSM) and remote sensing multispectral images respectively, and then urban thermal radiation can be determined by combining temperature measurement on the ground level.

J	Cohen, DA				Cohen, Daniel Aldana			New York City as 'fortress of solitude' after Hurricane Sandy: a relational sociology of extreme weather's relationship to climate politics	ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS			English	Article						Extreme weather; climate politics; relational sociology; disaster; New York City; urban planning	PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCE; RISK	How did New York City's climate politics change after Hurricane Sandy, and why? Prevailing accounts of extreme weather's impact on climate politics draw on survey data and characterize climate policy in vague terms. However, weather does not do the work of politics; the specifics of climate policy matter. I develop a relational sociological approach focused on mobilized actors, political economy, and event theory. Drawing on interviews and document analysis, I show how senior disaster officials, New York's Mayor Bloomberg and his Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, community groups and Occupy Sandy activists responded to Hurricane Sandy. Actors maintained outlooks and practices consistent with their position in the city's power relations. This selective continuity shifted New York's climate policy from decarbonization-focused tentative cosmopolitanism to adaptation-focused defensive parochialism. I term this convergent prioritization of adaptation a 'fortress of solitude' social logic. Only subsequent events explain New York's 2019 low-carbon legislation.

It takes, however, about one year to set up because of the present Japanese digital mapping technology such as the quality of digital mapping data, the data generating and overlaying method and surveying method at both urgent and ordinary times, On the other hand, many municipalities intend to use GIS on usual works of the property tax, the resident registration, infrastructure management, urban planning and emergency works in an urban disaster from our recent questionnaires. One of the most critical problems using the GIS in municipal works is the expensive cost to make the digital map. This paper introduces our system and describes the possibility to reduce the cost up to the present Japanese digital mapping situation to promote the GIS for all of the municipalities over 3,000 from our experiences this time.

WHO proposed, "It is necessary to secure the citizens' healthy life and create the healthy city". At present, because of the wooden building overcrowdedness in urban areas of Tokyo Bay, there are several unhealthy districts there. Therefore, an unhealthy district should be remodelled into a healthy city in the urban planning according to the WHO proposal. The healthy city level of urban areas of Tokyo Bay was evaluated from two analyses using GIS and Remote Sensing by TM & IKONOS. This study does detailed analysis of two areas to detect the degree of wooden building overcrowdedness by using only Remote Sensing Analysis by TM & IKONOS. Two indices of the vegetation and the urbanization were considered how there was effectiveness as a disaster prevention project index in two selected municipal districts. This Part 3. research using Remote Sensing analysis reports on a new urban planning technique which will enable areas to regain healthy city levels in urban areas of Tokyo Bay.

It also plays an important role in the earthquake disaster assessment. We propose a finite element model to simulate the strong ground motion excited by local earthquake. Then the peak ground acceleration (PGA) as well as the peak ground velocities are calculated accordingly with the displacement distribution with the respect of time. Fuzhou is the capital city of Fujian province, which locates in the coastal area of southeast China. It is characterized by the conspicuous basin structures with major fault zones. It is very easy to be subjected to hazards from the local strong earthquakes. This makes Fuzhou as an ideal test-bed to investigate the behaviors of the strong ground motion triggered by the possible future earthquakes. By taking advantage of large-scale finite element simulation, the peak ground displacements, peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity patterns are put forward by elaborately designed post-processing routines. These quantitative results can provide critical elements for the future urban planning, and future earthquake hazards prediction.

Importance of its consideration is that it allows to look in a new way at dynamics of interindustry communications which is insufficiently in detail studied in relation to the town-planning legislation unlike many other branches of the right, for example, of civil law. Considering this principle in the context of the main institutes of the town-planning right, the author shows the mechanism of accounting of requirements for protection of cultural heritage and OOPT by preparation of all types of town-planning documentation, including documents of territorial planning and town-planning zoning. In article existence of a problem of account in town-planning documentation of special legal status of the objects of natural heritage which are not a part of OOPT is noted. GRK Russian Federation repeatedly mentions objects of cultural heritage and sets the bans and restrictions in the sphere of town-planning activity aimed at providing their safety, however never mentions objects of natural heritage though both of these terms are enshrined in one Convention. As categories "object of natural heritage" and OOPT do not coincide, it is possible to draw a conclusion that GRK Russian Federation does not contain the appropriate mechanism of guarantees of protection of natural heritage. The author also makes the offer to consider during town-planning activity not only a legal regime of valuable natural objects and complexes (OOPT), but also ecologically unsuccessful territories which typical example are zones of ecological catastrophe.

Visualizing the risk of geological disasters can provide scientific references for regional engineering construction, urban planning, and disaster prevention and mitigation. There are some problems in the current binary classification landslide risk assessment model, such as a single sample type, slow multiclass classification speed, large differences in the number of positive and negative samples, and large errors in classification results. This paper introduces multilevel landslide hazard scale samples, selects multiple types of samples according to the divided multilevel landslide hazard scale grade, and proposes a landslide hazard assessment model based on a multiclass support vector machine (SVM). Due to the objective limitations of the single weighting method, the combined weights are used to determine the vulnerability of the landslide hazard-bearing body, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy method are combined to construct a landslide vulnerability assessment model that considers subjective and objective weights. This paper takes landslide disasters in Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, as the research object. Based on the landslide hazard assessment model and the landslide vulnerability assessment model, a landslide risk assessment experiment is carried out. It generates the landslide risk assessment zoning map and summarizes the risk characteristics of landslides in various towns. The experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and provide important decision support for decision makers in Xianyang City.</p>	[Xu, Shenghua; Liu, Jiping; Wang, Yong; Chen, Jie] Chinese Acad Surveying & Mapping, Beijing 100830, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Meng] Beijing City Interface Technol Co Ltd, Beijing 100830, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yu; Ma, Xinrui] Liaoning Tech Univ, Sch Geomat, Fuxing 123000, Peoples R China		Zhang, M (autor correspondente), Beijing City Interface Technol Co Ltd, Beijing 100830, Peoples R China.	xushh@casm.ac.cn; glmzhang2@gmail.com; 472120764@stu.lntu.edu.cn; liujp@casm.ac.cn; wangyong@casm.ac.cn; 472020767@stu.lntu.edu.cn; giserchenj@gmail.com	Ma, Yu/AFW-1430-2022	Liu, Jiping/0000-0001-9275-3250	National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFC1511704]; Basic Research Fund of CASM [AR2011]	National Key Research and Development Program of China; Basic Research Fund of CASM	FundingThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2020YFC1511704) and the Basic Research Fund of CASM (Grant No. AR2011).

J	Macedo, FR; de Souza, ML				Macedo, Felipe Rodrigues; Souza, Marta Luzia de			TECHNOLOGICAL RISK CHARTER FOR URBAN PLANNING AID AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING IN MARINGA/PR	REVISTA FORMACAO ONLINE			Portuguese	Article						Resilient cities; Disasters; Land planning		In the 2030 Agenda, drawn up by the United Nations (UN), which Objective 11 addresses inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities. One goals is disaster risk reduction. Thus, the charter of technological risks is an important tool for planning the territory, aimed at preventive actions, mitigation and responses to reduce or even avoid disasters. In this context this research aimed at technological risk mapping in the city of Maringa, Parana. This has been done mainly by secondary data, in which the research was developed in three steps (I - Pre-geoprocessing; II - Geo-processing, and III - Post-geoprocessing). Stage I for gathering existing data; Stage II for analysis of data obtained and drafting of cartographic documents, and Stage III for local reality check. We have also employed data from chemical / industrial, nuclear and radiological activities and, transport enterprises. Results have shown that mapmaking has enabled the verification of areas of greatest technological risk in the city, being in industry, near roads, railways and airports, but also in the centre of town, due to the rail tunnel. The technological risk chart can aid urban planning and in contingency plans pursuant to current international and national regulations, striving for prevention and mitigation of technological disasters.

Zero Cost Solutions of Geo-Informatics Acquisition, Collection and Production for Natural Disaster Risk Assessment	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Geo-informatics; GIS data acquisition; GIS data production; natural disasters		The global and local impacts of climate change and natural disasters cause great casualties and economic losses each year. Catastrophic events bring more damage to urban areas than rural places because of the high density of human population, property and the infrastructures. Geo-informatics is critical for all stages of disaster management including disaster prevention, preparedness, emergency decision making, disaster relief, rebuilding and recovery. It is critical for risk assessment of natural disasters. Since all hazard risk components are location-specific and vary spatially, accurate risk assessment relies on geo-informatics. Geo-informatics as the basis of decision-making information has proved to be critical and essential to natural, technological and manmade disaster risk assessments. Commercial sources of geo-informatics are usually expensive, especially for those developing countries and regions where living standards are low but natural disasters occur more frequently and cause large losses. The expense of geo-informatics acquisition, collection and production varies vastly with different update frequency, imagery quality, and the total amount of information carried. In contrast with commercial sources, free sources of geo-data and geo-software have limited comparable features. However, they have the flexibility to add new features by further development. Based on a current study of urban natural disaster risk assessment and vulnerability mapping which aims at improving community safety and resilience to natural hazards, this paper shares our experience on zero cost solutions of geo-informatics acquisition, collection, and semi-automatic production procedures by using free internet resources of Google Maps, Google Earth, and free and/or open source software including QGIS (Quantum GIS), GRASS, SAGA, Monteverdi, Sextante GIS and Orfeo Toolbox. In order to enrich attributes to meet the requirements of risk assessment, methods of combining the acquired geo-informatics with other formats of geo-data (e.g., Digital Elevation Model, raster layers, vector layers, and Microsoft Excel files) are introduced. The purpose of this paper is to share our experience on zero-cost geo-informatics acquisition, collection and production solutions with urban planning managers, emergency managers, risk researchers and people with similar concerns. The geo-informatics developed from this research forms a basis for disaster vulnerability measurement which is an important part for urban disaster risk assessment.	[Zou, Z.

Before determination of these risks, taking action in order to decrease the vulnerability levels of the residential areas will help keep the damage at the minimum level in case of a disaster. Urban planning decisions which are made in accordance with vulnerability studies aiming to determine natural disaster risks will not only help prevent loss of life but also help decrease negative social and economic effects of disasters. The Zonguldak city has been chosen as a case study area since Zonguldak metropolitan area has endured almost all kinds of threats that a city can face. In this study disaster-producing factors in the area are primarily considered which can be named as topography, destruction of forest lands, geological and karstic structure, mining activities, and misuse of the land, and later risk assessment is conducted with geographic information system (GIS). It has been assessed that more than half of the buildings within the study area were constructed in areas not suitable for housing. It is concluded that there is a need for urgent urban development plan for the city.

Nevertheless, how earthquake-induced direct economic losses (DELs) depend on earthquake energy dissipation and asset value exposure is still rarely known. Based on the estimated asset value exposure and the estimated earthquake energy for DELs produced by earthquakes over the period from 1990 to 2016 in China, the economic concept of elasticity is used to quantify the statistical relationship between DELs, asset value exposure and earthquake energy. The results show that asset value exposure and earthquake energy are correlated with earthquake DELs. On average, changes in asset value exposure have been relatively more important in explaining earthquake DELs than changes in earthquake energy. Moreover, a doubling in asset value exposure increases the DEL by 60% while a doubling in energy dissipation leads to a 31% increase in the DEL, and these results could be used for DEL predictions for new emerging earthquakes. This study suggested that the accumulation of wealth in earthquake-prone regions under economic growth will inevitably increase DELs if there are no changes in mitigation efforts. These findings also emphasize human behavior in determining the difference between a hazard and a disaster and provide significant insights in urban planning and disaster risk reduction strategies.

Every year a large number of geological disasters pose a serious threat to the safety of human life and property, and the effective management of geological disasters has become one of the major difficulties facing our country. This paper mainly studies the risk assessment of geological hazards of the line landslide based on remote sensing and GIS. Combined with detailed survey items of geological disasters in a certain area, this paper evaluates and analyzes the distribution and development characteristics of landslide geological disasters in the study area. Disaster assessment is an important part of disaster prevention and mitigation, and provides important references for local infrastructure construction, tourism development, urban planning and regional economic development. It can be known from the experiments in this paper that the evaluation results based on the hierarchical entropy variable weight method are more accurate, and the accuracy rate is 67%. The hierarchical entropy variable weight method can not only synthesize the rich experience of experts, but also reduce the subjective impact by introducing an entropy algorithm, thereby obtaining more accurate evaluation results.

City Geographic Markup Language (CityGML) is an open data model and XML-based format for the representation and exchange of virtual 3D city model. This paper analyzed the modeling mechanism of 3D CityGML building model in LOD4 (Level of Detail) and proposed a method representing a fire event in CityGML. Our method included three operations: 1) editing of building's hierarchy and attributes information; 2) representing of semantic information of buildings surfaces, roof height and interior furniture; 3) representing of fire event by a vivid icon. With our method, 3D building model and indoor fire event can be both represented in CityGML, which is important to analyses urban emergency events.

Hence, regular and up-to-date information on urban changes is required for urban planning and disaster management. In this study, two temporal TerraSAR-X images are used to monitor urban changes. The study area is focused on a part of central Tokyo, Japan. Firstly, the changes between two images are checked by color composition. Then the difference and the correlation coefficient between the two images are calculated with a sliding window. A new factor that combines the difference and the correlation coefficient is proposed to detect changed areas. Finally, two high resolution optical images are introduced to verify the accuracy of the detection results.

We propose a model which is a union of a high precision network and a high recall network. Both the networks are based on deep U net. Massachusetts road dataset is used in the experiments. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms stateof-the-art frameworks in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and I+ -score.

China cities have taken many measures to control the outbreak, which are timely and effective, but the problem and weaknesses in the urban planning stage have emerged. At the urban level, a comprehensive disaster prevention planning for the dual situations of normality and epidemic should be concerned. At the community level, the necessary improved facilities, the reasonable form, optimized spatial structure can support to construct a resilient community. At the architectural level, it is necessary to conceive the variation of residential buildings and the flexibility of living space to respond to the changes in daily lives in the Post-epidemic Era.

J	Surjan, AK; Shaw, R				Surjan, Akhilesh Kumar; Shaw, Rajib			'Eco-city' to 'disaster-resilient eco-community': a concerted approach in the coastal city of Puri, India	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Article						Eco-city; Eco-community; Urban environmental risk; Traditional knowledge and practices; Local environment		The need for environmental and urban planning reached a critical point in the year 2007, when one-half of the world's population could be defined as living in cities. Urbanisation in India is also increasing at a fast rate. Urban chaos in India, emanating from the continuous ignorance of fragile ecosystems, calls for the reshaping of existing cities as 'eco-cities'. The 'eco-city' -a well-known concept in the western world-is new to the Indian context. While western connotations of eco-cities should not be discarded outright in the context of India, core concerns vary significantly for obvious reasons. Recognising two facts firstly, eco-city development is altogether a fresh approach to human settlement development in India, and, secondly, the manifold increase in the vulnerability of cities-this paper discusses documented good practice, reinforcing evolution towards the eco-city vision. Lessons drawn from the examples cited are further deconstructed in the light of their contribution to urban risk reduction, which provides direction to appreciating the 'disaster-resilient eco-community' concept in Puri, a coastal city in India. Further, this paper attempts to unravel existing community-based practices in Puri, which are boon to the local environment and invariably reduce disaster risk. These seemingly modest neighbourhood initiatives symbolise immense societal wealth, which can be calibrated appropriately for reducing urban environmental risk as well. This paper also illustrates how a 'disaster resilient eco-community' approach is inevitable in the present and future contexts not only to preserve sustainable development gains but also to secure human well-being.

The global displacement scale due to disasters between 2008 and 2014 stands at an alarming rate of over 25 million lives on an average. Chennai floods 2015 has been the trigger for us to visualize the disaster management issue in various dimensions and come up with an approach by leveraging emerging technologies which has the potential to disseminate alerts seamlessly. The objective is to put forth some ideas on utilizing the existing information databases and signals from prevailing alert systems and integrate it using emerging technologies by leveraging the power of digital forces such as Mobility, Social media and Analytics. The proposed conceptual architecture could get data of various types and alerts in real time, process data streams and group them based on metadata and alert appropriate stakeholders. This proposed conceptual system based on the secondary research highlights how the benefits could be taken to various stakeholders such as government authorities, volunteers, media, residents of the disaster prone area and local authorities in those areas. The digital forces such as mobility, cloud computing, analytics and social media are fast emerging and the computing resources are available at a much lower costs almost like a commodity. This paper also leaves room for futuristic research in the IT technologies and their interoperability, performing analytics on the available inputs at the time of crisis and maximize the benefit to society and also emphasizes on smart integrated communication using cutting edge IT technologies.

Substantial hazard data are reported by newspapers, which could add value to disaster management decision making. In this study, a text-mining program extracted keywords related to floods' geographic location, date, and damages from newspaper analyses of flash floods in Fujairah, UAE, from 2000-2018. The paper describes extracting such information as well as geocoding and validating flood-prone areas generated through geographic information system (GIS) modeling. The generation of flood-prone areas was based on elevation, slope, land use, soil, and geology coupled with topographic wetness index, topographic position index, and curve number. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) produced relative weight for each factor, and GIS map algebra generated flood-prone areas. AHP inclusion helped minimize weight subjectivity among various experts. Of all areas, 85% are considered medium and low flood-prone zones, mainly mountainous areas. However, the 15% that are high/very high are dominated by urban areas in low coastal plains, predisposing them to flash floods. Eighty-four percent of flood events reported by newspapers were in areas rated as high/very high flood-prone zones. In the absence of flood records, newspapers reports can be used as a reference. Policymakers should assess whether flood-prone area models offer accurate analyses. These findings are useful for organizations related to disaster management, urban planning, insurance, archiving, and documentation.	[Yagoub, M.

Their consideration in some of the main global frameworks such as the IPCC report or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction has raised additional attention. However, these approaches are still more associated with rural than urban areas, although many urban areas face a high risk of natural hazards and the benefits of ecosystem-based measures to reduce it have already been proven in different cities. A successful implementation of ecosystem-based approaches in urban areas is highly complex. Using the city of Rio de Janeiro as case study, we first examine on the municipality level the responsibilities of the different institutions involved in landslide risk reduction and their technical and organizational interfaces. In a second step we zoom into two marginal settlements to determine whether ecosystem-based measures for landslide risk reduction already exist and assess the potential to either implement or further increase their application. These so-called favelas are often constructed on or beneath steep and degraded slopes prone to landslides. Landslides are mainly triggered by heavy rainfall events which are likely to increase in the future due to the impacts of global climate change. Activities to reduce landslide risk are distributed between many different actors, such as civil defense, geological survey, urban planning, and environmental management, and the measures taken are predominantly engineered approaches with a focus on preparedness and response. The urban reforestation program which could provide additional ecosystem benefits is not yet aligned enough with risk reduction and faces several challenges. In addition, the consideration of informal settings in formal urban planning and management strategies can still be improved. Based on quantitative and qualitative data from interviews and secondary sources, site visits, and expert interviews with representatives from public authorities and other stakeholders, the research assesses the individual institutional approaches as well as the overall urban governance system with regard to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The potential governance challenges for fostering ecosystem-based approaches are analyzed and clustered to provide an insight on paths that could facilitate the future consideration of Eco-DRR/EbA in Rio de Janeiro and beyond.

Design/methodology/approach-The authors illustrate new steps of a multidisciplinary research conducted by merging different fields of study, such as disaster risk analysis, sustainable land use and urban planning, environmental assessment methods, different buildings safety topics and certification and auditing management systems tools. Findings-This work is based on research developed in Italy by carrying out new tests in the coastal regions of Liguria and Tuscany to validate improvements and to confirm in different territories the assessment process of most significant natural and man-made hazards already included in the certification scheme previously developed on the basis of the continental regions of Lombardy and Piedmont. Originality/value-Investigations and results give firmer foundations and exploitability to a certification such as the one presented here.

In the article, using the case study of the Italian city of Bacoli (near Naples), I'll explore the possibilities offered, in the emergency planning, by the sea as a specific escape route in case of natural disaster. The reflection starts from an examination of the particular orography and geography of the Phlegraean coast, the area topography, the level of interconnections and infrastructures. The strategies developed during the preparation of the emergency and civil protection plan, from which this article starts, identify in the waterfront, especially adapted, infrastructured and safe, a fundamental option in the management of major emergencies of the Phlegraean area.

J	Chen, GB				Chen, Guobin			GIS method and its application for harmonious evaluation of urban construction land and geological environment	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Urban construction; Geological environment; Coordination; Geographic information technology	HYDROGEOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT	In order to better plan urban construction land, improve the efficiency of urban land use, and reduce the loss of people's lives and property caused by geological disasters, from the point of view of regional coordinated development, considering the geological environment assessment and land use types of planning areas, geographic information technology (GIS) is used in this study to reveal the coupling and coordination relationship between urban construction land and geological environment; and reasonable urban land use planning proposals are put forward. Through comprehensive analysis, urban planning land types are classified into four categories, which are residential and public facilities land, industrial and warehousing logistics land, supporting functional land, and ecological greening land. According to the requirements of various types of urban planning land for the quality of geological environment, and combined with the results of the coordinated zoning of urban construction geological environment, the corresponding urban construction suggestions are put forward respectively for the highly coordinated area, the basic coordinated area, the slightly imbalanced area, and the seriously imbalanced area of urban construction land and geological environment. Therefore, this study provides a scientific basis for the planning and layout, land use, disaster prevention, and mitigation of various cities in China, and is of great significance to the progress of urbanization in China.

J	Alvarez, K				Alvarez, Kerby			THE JUNE 1863 AND THE JULY 1880 EARTHQUAKES IN LUZON, PHILIPPINES: INTERPRETATIONS AND RESPONSES	ILLES I IMPERIS			English	Article						Earthquakes; religious responses; Spanish bureaucracy; Jesuits; colonial engineers	JESUITS; SCIENCE	This paper presents a historical analysis of the response of the government and the people after the June 1863 and July 1880 earthquake disasters. It provides a discussion of the extent of damage caused by the two earthquakes, and the post-disaster responses of the Spanish civil government in Manila and the central government in Madrid. This study also narrates the varying interpretations of the earthquakes, from the point of view of the Church, and from the perspective of the scientific community. The two earthquakes became profound catalysts for the changes that had taken place in its immediate aftermath. First, it prompted the civil government to initiate and implement a systematic disaster response plan and to institutionalize earthquake studies as a prerequisite in crafting seismic engineering and architectural plans for the communities. Second, what transpired after the two earthquakes revealed the long-standing problems in the bureaucracy and the need to implement modern and scientific approaches to urban planning and infrastructural integrity of the city. Ultimately, these catastrophic events paved the way for the institutionalization of scientific, architectural,and public engineering reforms in the colony.

However, attribute data acquisition and classification depend on manual editing works including ground surveys. In general, airborne photogrammetry and LiDAR measurements are applied to geometrical data acquisition for automated map generation and revision. However, these approaches classify geometrical attributes. Moreover, ground survey and manual editing works are finally required in attribute data classification. On the other hand, although geometrical data extraction is difficult, SAR data have a possibility to automate the attribute data acquisition and classification. The SAR data represent microwave reflections on various surfaces of ground and buildings. There are many researches related to monitoring activities of disaster, vegetation, and urban. Moreover, we have an opportunity to acquire higher resolution data in urban areas with new sensors, such as ALOS2 PALSAR2. Therefore, in this study, we focus on an integration of airborne LIDAR data and satellite SAR data for building extraction and classification.

J	Chester, DK				Chester, DK			The 1755 Lisbon earthquake	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Review						earthquake; hazard planning; liquefaction; Lisbon; source mechanisms; theodicy; three-way seismic interaction	TSUNAMI DEPOSITS; PORTUGAL; THEODICY; SEDIMENTATION; ALGARVE	Affecting an area of ca. 800 000 km(2) and killing up to 100 000 people, the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 is probably the greatest seismic disaster to have struck western Europe. The shock waves of the earthquake placed a temporary brake on the emerging rationalism of the European Enlightenment and attempts to explain the disaster in terms of human sinfulness coloured many contemporary accounts. Notwithstanding these difficulties, through careful archival research it has proved possible to obtain relatively value-free accounts of most aspects of the earthquake and to use these not only to model the physical characteristics of and damage caused by the earthquake, but also to consider the implications for present day hazard assessment and urban planning. This paper reviews the progress that has been made in: identifying source and faulting mechanisms; the processes involved in the generation and impact of tsunamis; damage caused to different types of building and the use being made of historical earthquakes of different sizes - of which the 1755 event is the largest - in defining future hazard scenarios for Lisbon and other areas of Iberia.

GIS is the merging of cartography, statistical analysis, and database technology, natural resource management, precision agriculture, photogrammetric, urban planning, emergency management, navigation, aerial video, and localized search engines.Today the concept of GIS is widely used in different areas of research and mankind. The disaster management systems are most based on GIS today, and the core idea of those systems is the past earthquake experiences. Remote sensing image processing can help government assess earthquake damage quickly. Taking this technology integrated with the quondam system can improve the assessment's precision of this kind of system. In this paper, we discuss a method which quickly evaluates the earthquake damage. Firstly, we discuss different cases and quick evaluation of earthquake damage by means of GIS based system. Secondly, analyzes the result by quick assessment. Thirdly, integrating the image processing module with the old system to get the new system, in which the assessment's precision can be improved.

J	de Andrade, MMN; Szlafsztein, CF				Nogueira de Andrade, Milena Marilia; Szlafsztein, Claudio Fabian			Community participation in flood mapping in the Amazon through interdisciplinary methods	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Amazon; Flood; Interdisciplinary methods; Urban planning	DISASTER MANAGEMENT; RISK; GIS	Community participation is an increasing issue in risk and disaster management. This paper argues that interdisciplinary methods are necessary for mapping flooding areas. On the one hand, hazards can be quantified and mapped through deductive approaches and methods from the natural sciences. On the other hand, hazards can also be described from the population perspective at a local level using social sciences methods. The methods are successfully mixed with a geographical information system environment. In the first case, important inputs include topographic and slope data for geomorphological mapping. In the second case, timeline methodology can indicate temporally the most severe floods, and a participatory map construction gives the population the opportunity to point out the affected areas. These methods were applied in a case study in the lower Amazon River Region in the urban area of the Santar,m municipality. High-resolution images and remote sensing were essential tools. Results show that nine neighborhoods have high and moderate susceptibility areas to riverine floods. Another nine neighborhoods are affected by flash floods. Flood mapping is the first step in risk mapping for the sustainability of regional planning.

Effective environment indicators on improving the resilience of Mashhad neighborhoods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Urban resilience; Adoption; Natural disaster; Resilience dimension; Urban planning	COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; SAMPLE-SIZE; DISASTER RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK; QUANTIFICATION; ADAPTATION; DIMENSIONS; METAPHOR; MODELS; CITIES	The concept of urban resilience has drawn more attention in recent years, especially in terms of urban planning. This concept is particularly highlighted when a city or community encounters threats such as natural hazards and rapid population growth. To respond to these threats, a comprehensive resilience assessment is required to identify priority areas for disaster risk management. Resilience is a multi-faced and complex concept, and any effort to evaluate it must take into account its social, economic, physical, and environmental dimensions. The city of Mashhad, as the second-largest city in Iran, is one of the most vulnerable cities due to being surrounded by several active faults, including Toos, Kashfarood, and Shandiz-Sang Bost. Since this city is located in a moderate to high earthquake risk zone, it is very necessary to pay attention to the resilience of this city against the earthquake crisis and implement management measures to increase the resilience capacity of this city. Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate urban resilience's capacity by introducing various indicators that promote resilience. This study focuses on two main domains: resilience dimensions and resilience criteria. This research has integrated three dimensions of resilience: social, cultural, physical, environmental, and economic, with four criteria of a resilient city: resistance, adaptation capacity, redundancy, and recovery to measure resilience capacity. A wide range of indicators covering all dimensions of resilience has been identified, enabling us to understand how resilient an area is structurally and functionally in the face of a natural disaster. Four neighborhoods of Mashhad (Khajeh Rabi, Sajjad, Honarestan, and Hijab) were selected as case studies. To calculate resilience capacity, each indicator of resilience dimensions was scored based on the analysis of statistical data and expert opinions. Findings show that all selected neighborhoods represent a moderate resilience against disasters like an earthquake. However, Sajjad has a higher resilience to face unexpected circumstances like an earthquake than the other three neighborhoods. According to the research findings, more structural and non-structural measures should be taken to improve resilience capacity, especially in the neighborhoods of Khajeh Rabi, Hijab, and Honarestan. This study concludes that urban resiliency in selected neighborhoods is strongly associated with social indicators such as residents' knowledge and awareness, the level of public participation, economic indicators including income and employment, as well as physical-environmental status in terms of urban and health infrastructure. The proposed framework for evaluating urban resiliency using various indicators in this study can be served as a basis for further investigations and development of methodologies that simultaneously consider the temporal and spatial dimensions of resilience.

J	Wamsler, C; Brink, E; Rivera, C				Wamsler, Christine; Brink, Ebba; Rivera, Claudia			Planning for climate change in urban areas: from theory to practice	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Adaptation; Climate change; Disaster; Risk reduction; Urban planning; Urban resilience; Urban transformation	CHANGE ADAPTATION; STRATEGIES; PERSPECTIVE; RESILIENCE	Climate change poses a serious threat to sustainable urban development, placing many cities at risk. As a consequence, city authorities are increasingly facing the challenge of finding ways to include adaptation strategies into their work, although related knowledge and competence is still scarce and fragmented. With the aim to contribute to knowledge development and organizational learning, the objective of this paper is to critically review and compare current theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning in cities. In order to do so, first the conceptual characteristics and features of a climate resilient city are identified. Second, the reciprocal linkages between climate-related disasters, urban form and city planning processes are analysed by considering the life cycle of disasters from causes, to short- and long-term impacts, to post-disaster response and recovery. Finally, urban adaptation measures proposed for both developed and so-called developing countries are assessed. On the basis of the identified differences, gaps and synergies between the theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning, the implications for improving sustainable urban transformation are discussed.

J	Liu, QL; Jian, WB; Nie, W				Liu, Qingling; Jian, Wenbin; Nie, Wen			Rainstorm-induced landslides early warning system in mountainous cities based on groundwater level change fast prediction	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Mountainous cities; Hazards prevention and mitigation; Rainstorm; Early warning system	WATER-LEVEL; BASIN; MODEL	Flood and landslides in mountainous cities triggered by rainstorm can severely impact people's lives, property and socioeconomic development. The pre-hazard early warning system are crucial to the disaster prevention, and would be an important part of smart city planning. This paper introduced a way to support the pre-hazard identification based on ground water level change fast prediction, which is the key factor for occurrence of the rainstorm-induced hazard. Firstly, the remote monitoring stations supplied by solar power are established, the data about the water content of surface soil and rainfall were real-time collected from different sensors. By introducing the sliding windows of historical data and for prediction, the early warning system are effective in pre-hazard identification as considering the vulnerable environmental factors such as rainfall, surface runoff, temperature, sunshine, vegetations, soil properties and structures. Based on the model analysis on the 4982 timeseries samples, taking the sliding window T=7d of historical data and sliding window G=7d for prediction as an example, the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the predicted result of the model reached 0.0812, with R2 up to 0.9776. Thus, Our study aims to provide a strategic way in quick response for the connection of pre-disaster planning and urban planning, and the improvement of disaster prevention, mitigation capacities, increasing the resilience of mountainous cities and their inhabitants.

J	Limongi, G; Galderisi, A				Limongi, Giada; Galderisi, Adriana			Twenty years of European and international research on vulnerability: A multi-faceted concept for better dealing with evolving risk landscapes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Vulnerability; Urban systems; Disaster risk; Urban planning; Review article	SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITY; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; EARTHQUAKE VULNERABILITY; ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY; URBAN VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE; RESILIENCE; LOSSES; TOOLS; MODEL	The pivotal role of vulnerability in disaster risk assessment and reduction makes it a highly explored - although still blurred - concept in the scientific debate. Therefore, a better understanding of the vulnerability concept is far from an academic exercise: it is still today of paramount importance to better coping with both current and emerging risks. The paper presents a review of European and international research on vulnerability over the past twenty years. The review has been carried out in two main steps: the analysis of selected European projects focused on vulnerability issues and carried out in the last 20 years; the analysis of scientific articles published over the last 20 years all over the world, selected through a Scopus search based on the main vulnerability facets identified by the EU projects. The review aims at exploring the state-of-the-art of research studies on vulnerability, by pointing out the definitions given for the multiple facets of vulnerability (social, physical, etc) and its spatial, systemic, and dynamic dimensions.

J	Hooper, M				Hooper, Michael			When Diverse Norms Meet Weak Plans: The Organizational Dynamics of Urban Rubble Clearance in Post-Earthquake Haiti	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						debris; disasters; disaster plans; Haiti; norms; organizations; Port-au-Prince; rubble; urban planning	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; WASTE MANAGEMENT; DISASTER; TSUNAMI; RECONSTRUCTION; SECTOR; AID	In the face of rapid global urbanization, cities are increasingly at risk from major disasters. While considerable attention has been given to other aspects of urban post-disaster recovery, less has been dedicated to rubble clearance. This article examines the dynamics of rubble clearance through a study of how the diverse organizations responding to the 2010 Haiti earthquake addressed this issue in Port-au-Prince. It draws on interviews with 52 organizations spanning the range of organizational types engaged in recovery efforts. Building on an evaluation of rubble clearance plans developed for other seismically at-risk cities, the results indicate that organizations in Port-au-Prince lacked a shared understanding of who should coordinate, and engage in, this vital activity. The diverse organizations involved in recovery brought widely diverging norms concerning rubble clearance to a context with weak plans in place for this task. The outcome was uncoordinated action and slow progress. The article draws on the literature on interorganizational norms to contextualize its findings from Port-au-Prince. It concludes by arguing for efforts to generate new, shared norms concerning who should lead urban rubble clearance and, in particular, for greater support for, and deference to, local plans around this issue. Such plans would enable governments to establish robust protocols to coordinate action on this increasingly important challenge for cities.

As one of the most distinguishing observations of climate change, sea level rise exacerbates marine disasters such as storm surge, coastal erosion, and seawater intrusion, which threaten the socio-economic development of coastal areas. As an expert on global climate change, the interviewee noted that ocean plays an absolutely dominant role in global climate system, and further emphasized the non-synchronicity and non-uniformity of global sea level rise. He also pointed out that basic research on global climate change needs to be more extensively applied in climatology, disaster prediction and control, urban planning and design, and other disciplines, in order to provide scientific support on risk assessment and management for urban construction of coastal regions.

Different applications where remote sensing is used are agriculture, disaster management, urban planning, water resource management, etc. The process of producing thematic map from remotely sensed imagery is called image classification. In one or more spectral bands digital numbers are used to represent spectral information. This information is used for digital image classification. Individual pixels are classified using this spectral information. For classification multispectral satellite images are used. Image classification can be supervised and unsupervised. The paper deals with the supervised classifiers namely minimum distance, support vector machine, maximum likelihood, and parallelepiped. The performance of these classifiers is judged on the basis of kappa coefficient and overall accuracy.

J	Matthew, RA; McDonald, B				Matthew, RA; McDonald, B			Cities under siege - Urban planning and the threat of infectious disease	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION			English	Article							BIOTERRORISM; OUTBREAKS; CAPACITY; ILLNESS	Many analysts argue that the potential for a natural, accidental, or nefarious infectious disease event to have a dramatic impact on urban areas in the United States and abroad is growing. After reviewing the justification for this position, this article considers what cities should do to prepare for a major disease event. Recognizing that prevention and preparation receive insufficient attention, we recommend that planners seek out and work with both public and private sector groups with roles in disaster planning; design land and transportation planning information systems to aid and support decision makers during crises; encourage greater self-sufficiency in food production and consumption; assist in the design of humane, realistic evacuation strategies and routes; and consider the effects of their day-to-day recommendations on disease risk and response.

Emergencies also occur in existing historical or non-historical cities, where it's necessary to impose an evacuation plan on the existing urban fabric, making it difficult to find the optimum plan for evacuating all of the population. This paper proposes several evacuation plans for the historical center of Thessaloniki, due to an accident in (each) one of the gas stations located in the historical city center, while having considered all the basic constraints to ensure all citizens use the best route to reach safety.

Assessment of urban resilience; a case study of Region 8 of Tehran city, Iran	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Resilience; Urban resilience; Urban resilience indicators; Region 8 of Tehran city; Factor analysis	ECOLOGY	Resilience thinking, its approaches, vocabulary, and metaphors are rapidly becoming part of the terms of urban planning, and evidence of resilience thinking can be found at all levels of decision-making, ranging from transnational to local levels. This paper tries to assess the urban resilience in Region 8 of Tehran city, Iran, without considering any special disaster. Specific attention in the paper is paid to analyzing indicators in assessment of urban resilience to find suitable ones in the case study. After analyzing questionnaires, the rank of urban resiliency was 2.6, which shows Region 8 of Tehran is in a low position in case of urban resiliency. (C) 2016 Sharif University of Technology.

NOAH is undertaking advanced disaster science research, comprehensive and multidisciplinary assessment of hazards while also developing accessible tools that enable local government units, community leaders, policy makers, planners, families, and individuals to prevent and mitigate disasters. UP NOAH's initiatives on disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) have continually built individual and institutional capacities and resilience using multidisciplinary research and risk assessment. With the completion of its three component projects (flood, landslide, and storm surge hazards mapping) last December 2015, UP NOAH proceeded to its next step in innovation: From hazard mapping to risk mapping. This is to even more enhance the disaster mitigation plans of communities in the Philippines. Embracing and taking advantage of information communication technology, the content of this user-generated mapping data are indeed vital in DRRM. Using the existing tools, techniques, and innovations of UP NOAH, a community-based adaptation fit for all levels of practitioners was introduced through Integrated Scenario-based Assessments of Impacts and Hazards (ISAIAH). The project helped enhance the knowledge of policymakers on areas that are safe for habitation as well as those that are suitable for longterm development. ISAIAH highlighted the emphasis of DRRM on strengthening preparedness and building stronger community resilience through persistent and constant information, education, and communication campaign using the internet and social media, as well as continuous personal visits to local communities where mapping workshops were conducted. This is essential as it recognized the actions needed to address the underlying reasons of disaster risk: poor urban planning among other man-made factors. In this way, adapting to the challenges of climate change in addition to DRR is given emphasis to help prevent significant loss of lives wrought by future disasters. (C) 2018 The Authors.

This risk assessment effort was developed under the framework of an integral disaster risk management project whose goal was to connect risk reduction activities by using open access and state-of-the-art risk models. A probabilistic approach was used for the analysis of seismic, landslide, and volcanic hazards to obtain stochastic event sets suitable for probabilistic loss estimation and to generate risk results in different metrics after aggregating in a rigorous way the losses associated to the different hazards. Detailed and high resolution exposure databases were used for the building stock and infrastructure of the city together with a set of vulnerability functions for each of the perils considered. The urban and territorial ordering plan of the city was updated for socioeconomic development and land use using the hazard and risk inputs and determinants, which cover not only the current urban area but also those adjacent areas where the expansion of Manizales is expected to occur. The emergency response capabilities of the city were improved by taking into account risk scenarios and after updating an automatic and real-time post-earthquake damage assessment.

J	Camur, KC; Korkmaz, C				Camur, Kubra Cihangir; Korkmaz, Cansu			Transformation of Urban Regeneration Legislation, Practice, and Planning Principles Conflict in a Construction-Led Economy: Ankara Case in Court Decisions	PLANLAMA-PLANNING			Turkish	Article						Urban regeneration; regeneration legislation; urban planning; court cancellation decisions; Turkey-Ankara		Urban regeneration and urban renewal processes and implementation of the projects are regulated by legislation. Turkey, as an outcome of its fragile and undeveloped political and economic structure, has adopted "a construction-led economic growth and urban regeneration strategy" as a policy to solve economic problems and in 2012 "disaster risky areas" were included within the scope of regeneration with the Law no 6306, which was prepared to transform and accelerate the urban regeneration. Putting forward "struggle with disaster risk" aims to eliminate obstacles leading delays in implementation of regeneration. Disaster-risky urban areas, and unbuilt areas and even the historical and conservation areas have been the subject of regeneration. In this study, "cancellations and court processes which includes determination and boundaries of regeneration areas, announcement and implementation of projects in the period of 2005-2012 in Ankara with high rate of cancellations" is examined. It is aimed to discuss the reasons behind failure to establish the expected relationship between planning principles and so called urban transformation, as well as to debate the conditions and possibilities of the integration of the economic and social components of the city with the planning processes. According to the results of the study, inconsistency of the plan scales in hierarchy; conflict with urban regeneration criteria; the lack of necessary surveys, analyses and assessments to determine urban transformation area boundaries; and the proposed additional building densities that are incompatible with the zoning rights and fair distribution, are the main problems.

Optimizing Temporary Rescue Facility Locations for Large-Scale Urban Environmental Emergencies to Improve Public Safety	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						environmental disaster; facility location; spatial optimization; multi-objective; dominance solution	MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; MODELING FRAMEWORK; OPTIMIZATION; SUPPLIES; GIS; COVERAGE; FIRE	Emergency rescue facility is an important component of urban system and affects public safety. Due to the special characteristics and complex environment of large-scale environmental disasters in urban areas, locations of emergency rescue facilities should be optimized. This study proposed an innovative methodological framework to optimize the locations of emergency rescue facility in the case of large-scale urban environmental disasters. A decision optimization model which consists of three-objectives representing service capacity, global efficiency and equity was developed. An appropriate spatial representation and encoding strategy was designed and coupled with the NSGA-II algorithm for model solving. Based on a hypothetical disaster scenario, a case study of Chaoyang district in Beijing is presented to demonstrate the methodology and explore the conflicting objectives. The results provide evidence that the model is able to successfully generate the Pareto-optimal frontier for the multi-objective emergency facility location problem, and provide a pool of alternative solutions to the decision-makers. The findings show that the framework proposed in this study has the potential to be a useful decision support tool for urban planning with respect to public safety.	[Zhao, M.; Chen, Q.

Relief operations were carried out to recover to previous state with no lesson learned analysis nor legislative upgrade. A window of opportunity opened to fulfill the disaster management cycle theory. On October/November 2011, when a wider event struck both Tuscany and Liguria regions causing 12 fatalities, the situation was, more or less, the same as the past year: the window of opportunity closed without a reduction in risk exposure. After this last event Ligurian Region administration started to re- evaluate hazard mapping and risk assessment methodologies, since debris floods were not considered in official hazard maps and urban planning regulations. But a month later, the temporary building restrictions were reformed to low strict level. Different to Northwest Italy extensive floods of 1994, that led Italy to a new approach to hazard planning and risk evaluation, Liguria 2010/2011 events did not to seemingly involve, bureaucracy and civil society on the new resilience concept and on the use of the emerging technologies and social media.

Examining related literatures and conducting interviews and surveys with a group of experts were carried out In order to derive proper measures. As a result, non-structural measures have been categorized as follows. (1) Urban planning measures such as land-use, park and Forestation plans, land acquisition and relocation plans, (2) architectural planning measures such as elevating the building basement or site. dry and wet flood-proofing() techniques, facility maintenance and repair, structural retrofitting or reinforcement, building greening and pavements with water permeability, and (3) regulatory system measures such as statutes, ordinances, flood prevention standards, public awareness and education, flood warning systems and flood insurance. Most of these categorized measures are feasible, but problems do exist, partially regarding insufficient legal support, lack of techniques,. and limited case studies. Even though the flood insurance system is In its early stages In Korea, it may be all integral and crucial non-structural measure for all advanced disaster prevention policy if the objective standards of risk assessment and various incentives are established	[Kang, Seok-Jin; Lee, Kyung-Hoon] Korea Univ, Dept Architecture, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Seung-Jae] Mokwon Univ, Div Architecture, Taejon, South Korea		Kang, SJ (autor correspondente), Korea Univ, Dept Architecture, Seoul, South Korea.

For various historical reasons, most of our primary and middle school buildings are old and various in structure, where some are of 6 or 7 stories, and with class of 60 to 70 students, which make potential obstacles for escape from dangers. On the other hand, schools are vulnerable when exposed to disasters because it has big population density, but the students are weak in independence and slow in reaction to dangers, all which hinder the evacuation. As a result, the key mission a designer of building faces is to make a sound planning and design, adopt the necessary escape facility, to realize a rapid escape in face of disaster and reduce casulty. To solve the said problems, we pooled experts from fields of urban planning, building design, structure engineering, behavior science and pyschology, etc, summarized the lessons from 512 Earthquake and other disasters, and conducted a systematic research in terms of site-choosing of the school, field design and design of building, escape facilities etc.	[Guo Chunyan; Liu Weibin] NE Forestry Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Harbin, Peoples R China			gcy_nefu@126.com						*GB, 500112001 GB; *GB, 1189 GB; *TJ, 1178 TJ	3	0	0	0	3	HARBIN INST TECHNOLOGY, P R CHINA	HARBIN	92 W DAZHI ST, NAN GANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150001, PEOPLES R CHINA			978-7-5603-2855-3	GRF ASIA PUBL SER			2010	1						237	243						7	Management	Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)	Business & Economics	BYI92					2022-07-12	WOS:000298969300040

CITIES			English	Article						Resilient city approach; Urban inequalities; social vulnerabilities; Shocks; stresses; Global south; Climate change; Salvador-Bahia-Brazil	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN RESILIENCE; CITIES; POLITICS; GOVERNANCE	We present how the city of Salvador in Brazil, has applied the resilience approach to its long-term urban planning agenda to both overcome past sequelae and face new challenges such as the increasing urbanization and climate change. Salvador launched its Resilience Strategy, which placed it at the forefront of cities investing in resilience to face their shocks and stresses. Salvador faces various economic and social vulnerabilities, which have been ongoing since the city was established in the 16th century. The lessons learned throughout the city's experience are that resilience plan and climate agendas must be carried out together with adaptation and mitigation actions and include: i) the need to develop a resilience strategy both to ensure disaster risk prevention and address all social and environmental aspects that are fundamental to building a resilient city, especially in contexts of poverty and inequality; ii) the significance of both engaging multiple stakeholders and thinking about inclusive resilience, as a complex and ongoing process of learning. We conclude that urban resilience policies should not only focus on disaster risk prevention by developing brown infrastructure plans but also need to address social and environmental-natural aspects as fundamental to building a resilient city.

J	Trundle, A				Trundle, Alexei			Resilient cities in a Sea of Islands: Informality and climate change in the South Pacific	CITIES			English	Article						Urban resilience; Informal settlements; Pacific SIDS; Climate change adaptation; Ecosystem services	URBAN RESILIENCE; STRATEGIES; ADAPTATION; MIGRATION; DISASTER	This paper demonstrates pathways for building on the resources, networks, and latent capacities of urban informality to enhance the climate resilience of urban systems, using post-disaster case study research from two Pacific Small Island Developing States to illustrate conceptual and practical opportunities for urban planning to engage constructively with endogenous resilience. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with informal settlement households (n = 57) and institutional representatives (n = 26) were used to identify informal modes of resilience, with secondary analysis of institutional projects and spatially-differentiated socio-economic data being integrated with these primary datasets. Findings demonstrate important distinctions in sub-city scales of resilience relating to values and equity within socio-ecological resilience research that have not been extensively studied to date. These case study observations have implications for understandings of 'core' systems functions, which are critical for planning communities when conceptualising resilience at a metropolitan level. Sub-city analysis also highlights aspects of urban resilience not previously identified in practice elsewhere, with informal maintenance of ecosystem services, use of kinship and familial networks, and translocation of traditional knowledge providing opportunities for enhancing urban climate change adaptation and climate resilient development initiatives.

The study employs linear regression, log-linear regression, and artificial neural networks (ANN) methods for cross-verification of results and for finding out the significant urban rent attribute(s) responsible for the damage. All models used are equally capable of predicting the earthquake damage and converge to similar results even if the data are limited. Of the rent variables, the physical density is proved to be especially significant in predicting earthquake damage, while the land value contributes to building resistance. Thus, urban rent can be the primary tool for planners to help reduce the fatalities in preventive planning studies.

Combined storm surge hazard assessment and zonation is an important method for coastal disaster risk reduction and mitigation management. Based on observational data from tide-gauge and hydrological stations in coastal areas, we analyzed storm surge hazard intensity and generated a storm surge hazard map at the county level using the expected values of storm surge and over-warning water levels. The results show that 87, 67, 62, and 40 counties along the coast of China are exposed to the first (highest), second (higher), third (medium), and fourth (low) degree of hazard level, respectively. The areas with the highest risk of storm surge are the coasts of Bohai Bay, Laizhou Bay, and the Yangtze Delta, the coast from the north of Fuzhou to the south of Zhejiang, and the coastal area of Huizhou, Pearl River, and Yangjiang in Guangdong Province. This assessment, which is based on a national storm surge hazards map, can provide decision-making support for the government's urban planning of coastal cities and site selection in large national projects.

Modelling of residential location choice of urban population with random forest	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							MAJOR ROADS; RISK; HEALTH; CLIMATE; POLICY; HAZARD	The most common approach to assessing natural hazard risk is investigating the willingness to pay in the presence or absence of such risk. In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling. Especially in urban environments, exposure and vulnerability are highly dynamic risk components, both being shaped by a complex and continuous reorganization and redistribution of assets within the urban space, including the (re-)location of urban dwellers. By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus. Avenues for future research include the operational strengthening of these linkages for more effective disaster risk management.

As a result, the fight against the negative effects of this risk has historically been a key element of hydrological planning and civil protection. In the 60th anniversary of the catastrophic flood that struck the city of Valencia, a discussion is made on the sufficiency of the infrastructures that were built to defend the city against new possible floods, reaching the conclusion that the risk has not been completely eradicated, and that new measures should be adopted in order to guarantee a higher degree of security. An analysis is made on the treatment that the plans on state, regional and local scale have over the city and the surrounding area, with the corresponding pronouncements made on the levels of flooding risk, and with the measures and limitations that must be observed in territorial and urban planning regarding the classifications of the soil, its uses and the urban regime.

A group composed of people from disciplines of geology, engineering, water and transportation, disaster response, development and urban planning, and environmental management were asked to comment on several topics about Landslide and land-use issues. The questions and an edited summary of their answers are included below: Their comments demonstrate the potential for real savings in both public and private funds by following prudent land-use planning and mitigation measures. This message, however, needs to be communicated all the way through the decision-making process. This message needs to be both HEARD and UNDERSTOOD, the public must come to BELIEVE the information, and the information must be packaged in a way that individuals can PERSONALIZE the message to ensure that they will indeed TAKE ACTION.

J	Solmaz, G; Turgut, D				Solmaz, Guerkan; Turgut, Damla			A Survey of Human Mobility Models	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Human mobility; mobility models; Internet of Things; smart cities	PEDESTRIAN MOBILITY; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS; SLAW	Human mobility models are key components of various research fields including transportation, mobile networks, disaster management, urban planning, and epidemic modeling. Understanding human mobility has a major role in the realistic evaluation of new approaches to challenges in these fields. For the perspective of networked systems, simulations of the networks with human participants such as opportunistic social networks are highly dependent on human mobility. In this article, we summarize the state of the art for scientific research on human mobility and survey the currently used human mobility models. We discuss the commonly used metrics and data collection techniques. Furthermore, we include a taxonomy of the mobility models according to their main characteristics and classify them. We lastly discuss the general trends, applicability, further research directions and open problems of human mobility modeling.

J	Lwin, K; Murayama, Y				Lwin, KoKo; Murayama, Yuji			A GIS Approach to Estimation of Building Population for Micro-spatial Analysis	TRANSACTIONS IN GIS			English	Article								Population data used in GIS analyses is generally assumed to be homogeneous and planar (i.e. census tracts, townships or prefectures) due to the public unavailability of building population data. However, information on building population is required for micro-spatial analysis for improved disaster management and emergency preparedness, public facility management for urban planning, consumer and retail market analysis, environment and public health programs and other demographic studies. This article discusses a GIS approach using the Areametric and Volumetric methods for estimating building population based on census tracts and building footprint datasets. The estimated results were evaluated using actual building population data by visual, statistical and spatial means, and validated for use in micro-spatial analysis. We have also implemented a standalone GIS tool (known as 'PopShape GIS') for generating new building footprint with population attribute information based on user-defined criteria.

Superpixel-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Georeferencing the Drone Images	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Image color analysis; Training; Labeling; Convolution; Image segmentation; Drones; Image edge detection; Convolutional neural network (CNN); georeferencing; superpixel		Information extracted from aerial photographs has been used for many practical applications such as urban planning, forest management, disaster relief, and climate modeling. In many cases, labeling of information in the photo is still performed by human experts, making the process slow, costly, and error-prone. This article shows how a convolutional neural network can be used to determine the location of ground control points (GCPs) in aerial photos, which significantly reduces the amount of human labor in identifying GCP locations. Two convolutional neural network (CNN) methods, sliding-window CNN with superpixel-level majority voting, and superpixel-based CNN are evaluated and analyzed. The results of the classification and segmentation show that both of these methods can quickly extract the locations of objects from aerial photographs, but only superpixel-based CNN can unambiguously locate the GCPs.

St. Petersburg Port through Disasters: Challenges and Resilience	JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY			English	Article						St; Petersburg; port cities; disaster; rebuilding; urban planning; resilience		Port cities are useful sites for thinking about resilience, as their location at the junction of sea, river, and railway routes is of prime importance to traders, governments, and other actors: these cities are rapidly redeveloped after disasters and create extensive measures to withstand such shocks in the future. This article concerns the main challenges facing the St. Petersburg port and city and how they were resolved from its origin in 1703 to date. It first tracks the city's resilience from the age of sail, when it was a port for trade, through the age of steam, when the port infrastructure completely changed as it was transferred from the historic center of the city to its outskirts. The second part of the article examines how St. Petersburg withstood specific challenges, both natural and man-made: ice, floods, shallowing, fires, and wars.

For this purpose, it is necessary to have at disposal a methodology enabling estimation of potential damages/losses caused to real property as well as allowing quick estimation of real property value in the target area. Outputs obtained through the methodology are relevant especially during the investment decision-making process on the implementation of natural hazards protection measures, for insurance purposes and/or for urban planning. The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of above mentioned type of methodology for hazards of windstorm and weight of snow and icing with regard to an existing methodology for floods.

The Synergy program is a NASA-funded activity designed to promote the use of EOS data and related remote sensing technologies for a variety of applications. Examples from the Synergy program indicate that EOS data are suitable for developing policy relevant applications in precision agriculture, management of natural resources, management of water resources, public health, urban planning and disaster management. There are however several barriers that need to be overcome before users outside the research community fully adopt these technologies. Some of the barriers include lack of awareness, experience and training by end users in these technologies, unproven cost benefits, and issues related to data formats, consistence and continuity.

The Case of Genoa	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						resilience; territorial security; urban planning; risk mitigation; stakeholder participation	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN RESILIENCE; ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; GOVERNANCE; INNOVATION; LESSONS	This paper analyzes some natural and man-made disasters that happened in recent years, which demonstrate how the resilience of a city does not depend only on the actions carried out by public authorities, but it requires the joint work of all actors that live or work in a city. Resilience represents the ability of an urban system to adapt to an external event and quickly return to normality. In recent years, urban resilience has mainly addressed natural risks, neglecting man-made disaster. Therefore, this study considers the risk issue in relation to the resilience concept within urban planning and policies to achieve sustainability and urban security. Urban resilience has become an important objective for cities, particularly to face climate change. The paper proposes a review of the existing Civil Protection Urban Emergency Plan, as a sector plan to support urban planning at the local level, aimed at building resilience in cities. In particular, the proposed Emergency Plan reduces risk and increases resilience by identifying specific scenarios and actions that every city actor-public authorities, research, enterprises, and citizens-can implement. This proposal contributes to the implementation of the quadruple helix principle, according to which the involvement of these four actors is necessary to achieve a common goal, such as increasing urban resilience. The proposed methodology is then applied to the man-made disasters that have involved the city (such as the flood of 2011 and the collapse of the Morandi Bridge in 2018). Genoa represents a good example to be studied according to the "learning-by-doing" approach to understand how the city has responded, adapting resiliently, to natural and man-made events thanks to the collaboration of all the actors above mentioned. The new scenarios, included in the Urban Emergency Plan, can play a fundamental role, both in the emergency and prevention phase, and can help other cities around the world in planning more resilient cities to face higher risks.

J	Wamsler, C				Wamsler, Christine			Mainstreaming ecosystem-based adaptation: transformation toward sustainability in urban governance and planning	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; green infrastructure; landscape planning; municipal planning; resilience; risk reduction; sustainability transitions; sustainable transformation; urban planning; urban transformation	ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY INTEGRATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT; SERVICES; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; ADDRESS; TRANSITIONS; RESILIENCE	The concept of ecosystem-based adaptation is advocated at international, national, and regional levels. The concept is thought to foster sustainability transitions and is receiving increasing interest from academic and governmental bodies alike. However, there is little theory regarding the pathways for its systematic implementation. It furthermore remains unclear to what degree the concept is already applied in urban planning practice, how it is integrated into existing planning structures and processes, and what drivers exist for further integration. Against this background, this study examines potential ways to sustainably mainstream ecosystem-based adaptation into urban planning. Eight municipalities in Southern Germany were investigated to analyze the processes of mainstreaming ecosystem-based adaptation into current planning practice. Although the mainstreaming entry points for ecosystem-based adaptation were identified to be appreciably different, the results of the study show how mainstreaming has generally led to patterns of change in: (1) on-the-ground measures, (2) organizational structures and assets, (3) formal and informal policies and instruments, (4) external cooperation and networking, and (5) the general working language. In all these areas, ecosystem-based adaptation to heat and flood risk is highly compartmentalized. Furthermore, although scholars have drawn attention to the risk of "mainstreaming overload," the results suggest that at the local level, the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation is strongly driven by departments' experience in mainstreaming other cross-cutting issues, namely environmental planning, climate change mitigation, and disaster risk management. Based on the findings, ways to leverage sustainability transitions via mainstreaming are discussed. It is concluded that systematic mainstreaming is a promising avenue for initiating and promoting local transitions and transformative adaptation. The study demonstrates the applicability of the presented mainstreaming framework for assessing and driving the mainstreaming capacity of local governments, thus also addressing the lack of related indicators highlighted in the Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

A catastrophe happens when a high-intensity or extreme natural event, like an earthquake, meets a vulnerable population with an unprepared decision-making authority. Environmental disasters in many cases are affected by human usage of natural resources, e.g. over-exploitation can cause man-made disasters. The Earth's population is expanding at a rate of 1.45% annually and has a strong tendency to congregate in ever-larger and more complex urban settings.. Each of the urban areas has a unique set of systems related to security, energy, water, nutrition, economics, and the environment. In the future the urban "system of systems" will become more vulnerable to the risks from natural events such as earthquakes. The recent earthquakes prove again that for the urban areas to be safe and sustainable it is necessary to implement long-range urban planning and risk assessment tools that rely on an accurate and multi-disciplinary urban modeling. We still need and must develop tools to act as hazard scenarios, and subsequently map the parameters necessary for the long range improvement planning of cities, which will then play the role of infrastructure "keys". The difficulty of this challenge is manifest in the spatially irregular patterns of damage that are typically observed after major earthquakes. The prevention of catastrophes in general is a consideration of urban spatial planning and at the regional and local levels. This work focuses on urban planning criteria using as a case study the city of Sofia (capital of Bulgaria), Sofia is a growing city with a population exposed to high seismic risks since it is located in the centre of Sofia seismic area where, over the centuries, the macroseismic intensities have been larger than IX (MSK). The desk-study of the Sofia metropolitan area combined the recent tectonic and geological information to characterize and estimate displacements and amplifications due to local geological conditions. The lack of instrumental recordings for Sofia fostered the studies on deterministic earthquake scenarios for the city to compute realistic synthetic seismic signals, due to several earthquake scenarios along chosen geological profiles crossing the city. A study of the site effects, and the microzonation of a part of metropolitan Sofia based on a modelling of seismic ground motion along three cross sections, are presented. Realistic synthetic strong motion waveforms have been computed for an expected scenario earthquake (M=7) applying a hybrid modelling method, based on the modal summation technique and finite differences scheme. The site amplification is determined in terms of response spectral ratio (RSR) reciprocal of the aggravation factor (AF). The results from the study constitute a "database" that describes the ground shaking of the Sofia urban area.

J	Schafran, A				Schafran, Alex			Origins of an Urban Crisis: The Restructuring of the San Francisco Bay Area and the Geography of Foreclosure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						regional restructuring; urban planning; foreclosure crisis; segregation; San Francisco; Oakland; Antioch; Stockton; Walnut Creek; USA	SEGREGATION; LOCALISM; REGIONALISM; GOVERNMENT; CITIES; LIMITS	Communities on the fringes of the American metropolis have recently garnered attention as the centers of the foreclosure crisis and its aftermath. On the one hand, this attention to the urban nature of the crisis is welcome, as the metamorphosis of the mortgage fiasco into a financial crisis-cum-global economic meltdown turned popular attention away from the urban roots of this calamity. But this emphasis on the exurbs as the site of crisis lends itself to the misconception that they, rather than the restructuring of the metropolis as a whole, are the sole source of the crisis. This article works across multiple scales to examine how three interwoven factors demographics, policy and capital each reacted to the San Francisco Bay Area landscape inherited at the end of the 1970s, affecting the region in new ways, leaving some places thriving and others struggling with foreclosure, which leads to plummeting property values and the deep uncertainty of the current American metropolis. This restructuring can be seen as the convergence between the unresolved urban crisis of the postwar era and the various reactions in the neoliberal era. It demands a reimagining of both planning and geography, especially from the left.

Regarding the instrumental perspective, there was difficulty in conducting the simulation-based PSS due to the enormous simulation time required. Regarding the transfer perspective, the importance of the municipality's decision of adopting the PSS to a project, securing the budget and continuous running costs, track record of the practical project, and lack of human resource for the PSS use were clarified. Regarding the user perspective, the difficulty in data collection and update as well as importance of the cooperative system/support from the developer in the initial period were clarified. Especially, considering the low number of implementations, a platform may be important for the promotion of PSS awareness. This may be also useful for the diffusion of PSS. It is necessary for the developers to fully communicate the benefits of PSS adoption. It is thought that a close cooperative system and support are required in the initial stage. For promoting and understanding the benefits of PSS adoption, a guideline or manual seems to be useful. This is effective for ensuring the budget and providing an explanation to high-level members of the organizations about the effect of utilizing these tools. For the final implementation, the possibility of installation, maintenance, and operation of the PSS by the municipality was discussed. (C) 2019 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

Measures in respond to natural disaster are searched for in various fields such as water management, energy, ecosystem, and health science. Resilient policies are being prepared to prevent disaster from flooding and drought through water management system, social infrastructure and green growth. Safety management for flood damage mitigation are being implemented through the regulation and public-private cooperation. This study aims to suggest new strategies planning of water management and land use in response to abnormal weather which allow waterfront spaces to be the cities by providing facilities and public spaces through the experience of resilient project in the Netherlands. Dutch national resilient policy and strategy is to developed multi-dimensional approach for flood risk which structure based on the spatial planning focused response. Feature of the Dutch water source management policies changed from the old water management as command and control focused on solution, monistic, rapid outflow of water with pumping, dikes, and drainage by hierarchical and closed sectoral water policy to the new water management of 21st as prevention and anticipation focused on design, retention and natural storage, participatory and interactive specific water by pluralistic societal anticipative and adaptive integral spatial policy. The water control strategy, for flexibly responding to the sea level rise and flooding caused by the climate change through the experience of Dutch resilience, is as follows: 1) Customized prevention plan according to the local property 2) Creating spatial planning by considering disaster risk level and fragility 3) Establishing urban planning by considering the flood risk level.

To design and implement more effective and democratic risk reduction programs, calls for transdisciplinary approaches have recently increased. However, little attention has been paid to the actual articulation of transdisciplinary methods and their associated challenges. To fill this gap, we draw on the case of the 1993 Quebrada de Macul disaster, Chile, to propose what we label as the Geo-Social Model. This experimental methodology aims at integrating recursive interactions between geological and social factors configuring landslide for more robust and inclusive analyses and interventions. It builds upon three analytical blocks or site-specific environments in constant co-determination: (1) The geology and geomorphology of the study area; (2) the built environment, encompassing infrastructural, urban, and planning conditions; and (3) the sociocultural environment, which includes community memory, risk perceptions, and territorial organizing. Our results are summarized in a geo-social map that systematizes the complex interactions between the three environments that facilitated the Quebrada de Macul flow-type landslide. While our results are specific to this event, we argue that the Geo-Social Model can be applied to other territories. In our conclusions, we suggest, first, that landslides in urban contexts are often the result of anthropogenic disruptions of natural balances and systems, often related to the lack of place-sensitive urban planning. Second, that transdisciplinary approaches are critical for sustaining robust and politically effective landslide risk prevention plans. Finally, that inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches to landslide risk prevention need to be integrated into municipal-level planning for a better understanding of-and prevention of-socio-natural hazards.

While the measurement of urban disaster resilience has recently gained much attention, there is so far no optimal approach for operationalizing this concept and therefore there is a need to conduct more empirical studies on what constitutes disaster resilience and how to assess it. In this study, a resilience assessment focuses on the inherent characteristics and capacities of Tehran in the context of flash floods from surface water or from the overflow of rivers. The measurement approach is based on constructing a composite index based on six resilience dimensions social, economic, institutional, infrastructural, community capital and environmental of community flood resilience. This follows by developing a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method. The applied method is a combination of the AHP for prioritizing the selected indicators and the TOPSIS tools in order to get Tehran's urban districts ranked based on their resilience levels. Data were mostly from the Statistical Center of Iran and Tehran Municipality's accessible data sources. The results clarify that Districts 6 and 22 are comparatively the most resilient districts, while District 1 is the only district with the lowest level of resilience. Such place-based assessments have an opportunity to track community performance over time and provide the tool to decision-makers in order to integrate resilience thinking into urban development and resilience-oriented urban planning.

Based on point of interest (POI) data, this study adopts POI spatialization and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to accomplish the spatial classification of construction land. Zhejiang province is selected as a study area, and its construction land is divided into 11 land types using an accurate spatial classification method based on measuring the area of ground items. In the research, the POI dataset, which includes information, such as spatial locations and usage types, was constructed by big data cleaning and visual interpretation and approximately 620,000 pieces in total. The overall accuracy of the confusion matrix is 76.86%, which is greatly improved compared with that constructed with EULUC data (61.2%). In addition, compared with the official statistical data of 11 cities in Zhejiang Province, the differences between the calculated spatial proportions and statistics are not substantial. Meanwhile, the spatial characteristics of the studied land-use types are consistent with the urban planning data but with higher accuracy. The research shows that the construction land in Zhejiang Province has a high degree of land intensity, concentrated assets, and high economic exposure. The approach proposed in this study can provide a reference for city management including urbanization process, risk assessment, emergency management and asset allocation.

The administration of Kaohsiung metropolitan containing the area of 2645.60 km(2) includes both Kaohsiung city and county governments. However, Most of hill slope areas are located at Kaohsiung County with 1970.62 km(2) which were occupied more than 70% of total Kaohsiung areas. Weak geological structure, uneven distributions of rainfall intensity, steep geomorphology and intensive development were identified as the predominated factors contributing to the slope failures at community on Kaohsiung slope land. Natural disasters damaging properties, infrastructure and human life can be serious all over Kaohsiung metropolitan area. To identify large scale soil mass movement, debris flow and surface runoff erosion by using satellite image processing system and aerial photography implementation on the surface of earth should be required in this project. Applications of GIS integrated with GPS and RS technology would also be necessary and critical for this research. This project was proposed as a three year study to establish a risk assessment model of environmental disasters and set up geo-hazard database systems for the communities on hill slope in Kaohsiung metropolitan. All results can give a fundamental guideline of sediment related disaster prevention. Hopefully, this guideline can help Kaohsiung city and county governments set up their own disaster prevention and mitigation systems to keep urban safe and well development in the future. It is expected that the establishment of this risk model and disaster database system can be used to help a well development of community on urban planning, designing and controlling the hazard mitigation of Kaohsiung area in southwestern Taiwan.

We aimed to identify level of buildings seismic vulnerability and population at risk in Tehran's Farahzad informal settlement in 2017. Methods: In this observational cross-sectional study, residential buildings were assessed for seismic performance of constructions. We screened 160 buildings according to Iranian national guidelines by Rapid Seismic Visual Screening Method as a tool to calculate and determine Level of Retrofitting (L-R) scores of buildings. We also interviewed residents of the buildings to collect data regarding socio-demographic data, individual disability status, Disaster Assessment of Readiness and Training (DART) regarding household disaster preparedness, and time occupancy in the buildings. Results: Overall, 160 buildings with 209 households and 957 individuals were surveyed. 97.5% of buildings were formed of heavy construction materials. None of them were categorized as engineered buildings and L-R of residential buildings ranged from 82.4% to 163.8% with a mean 117.9%. L-R scores of more than 100% were capped as 100%. Vulnerable groups of the sample population include under-five years old (8.7%), 60 yr old and above (6.7%), and 9.1% of households had at least one disabled member. 16.7% of households were living in homes with dense area. The DART score for 94.3% of surveyed households was zero. Conclusion: Disaster managers in Tehran municipality must design and implement a comprehensive risk reduction plan inpoor urban areas as vulnerable regions for earthquake hazard.

Though rapid urbanization provides a huge employment opportunity for people, urban threats also increase proportionately due to natural and man-made hazards. Understanding urban resilience and sustainability is an urgent matter to face hazards in the rapidly urbanized world. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the concept and develop key indications of urban resilience and sustainability from the existing literature. A systematic literature review guided by PRISMA has been conducted using literature from 1 January 2001 to 30 November 2021. It argues that sustainability and resilience are interrelated paradigms that emphasize a system's capacity to move toward desirable development paths. Resilience and sustainability are fundamentally concerned with preserving societal health and well-being within the context of a broader framework of environmental change. There are significant differences in their emphasis and time scales, particularly in the context of urbanization. This study has identified key indicators of urban resilience under three major components like adaptive capacity (education, health, food, and water), absorptive capacity (community support, urban green space, protective infrastructure, access to transport), and transformative capacity (communication technology, collaboration of multi-stakeholders, emergency services of government, community-oriented urban planning). This study also identified several indicators under major dimensions (social, economic, and environmental) of urban sustainability. The findings will be fruitful in understanding the dynamics of urban vulnerability and resilience and its measurement and management strategy from developed indicators.

DISTRIBUTION ANALYSES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN A SITUATION OF TECHNOLOGY RISK EXPOSURE IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF JUIZ DE FORA - MG, BRAZIL	REVISTA FORMACAO ONLINE			Portuguese	Article						Technological risks; Schools safety; Primary and secondary teaching schools		Urban planning as well as public policy educationally related are indispensable actions aiming at the safety of students, teachers and employees of primary and secondary schools in Brazil. It becomes important to expand the concept of safety leading it to embrace not only health, food and accidents in school related initiatives, but also by focusing on dangers related to natural and technological processes that may affect a community. For this reason, the objective of this research was to spatialize primary and secondary schools situated in the central area of the municipality of Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Starting from a mapping of technological risks produced and made available by the first author of this work in which avenues, railways, petrol stations, fuel depots, hospitals, gas pipelines and dangerous army depots have been considered. The schools were specialized into maps allowing them to be viewed concomitantly with the various levels of technological risk. Out of a list of 79 identified schools, 31, i.e. 39% of them are in worrying risk classes - extremely high, high, and medium levels - for which it is suggested strategies to increase safety based on the recommendations of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction just as on Disaster Prevention Standards in Brazilian Municipalities.

In the context of earthquakes, the built environment directly relates to a disaster's outcome in terms of loss of life and property. Hence it becomes imperative to assess the built environment and minimize the seismic impact comprehensively. The currently available literature focuses on the individual elements of the built environment operating as independent domains of research. However, this article emphasizes the need to understand the built environment from an ecosystem perspective where each element interacts to produce a comprehensive disaster effect. Utilizing urban planning as a seismic risk reduction tool, this paper identifies the elemental composition of the urban environment and proposes a framework to assess the Built Environment Vulnerability (BEV). The study functions at the mid-scale resolution and introduces two new concepts, Discrete and Systemic Vulnerabilities. A total of 1107 buildings and 134 kilometers of road have been surveyed, and object-oriented analysis is carried out in six neighborhoods of Siliguri Municipal Corporation, India. The results are the differential BEV pre and post-earthquake across the six neighborhoods corresponding to their different built characteristics.

J	Moisidi, M; Vallianatos, F; Gallipoli, MR				Moisidi, Margarita; Vallianatos, Filippos; Gallipoli, Maria Rosaria			Assessing the Main Frequencies of Modern and Historical Buildings Using Ambient Noise Recordings: Case Studies in the Historical Cities of Crete (Greece)	HERITAGE			English	Article						HVSR spectral ratios; ambient noise; historical monumental building; Crete		Monitoring seismic structural response is an essential issue in earthquake risk assessments and mitigation studies for monumental buildings in order to undertake earthquake disaster management. This study aims at identifying the resonant frequency of soil and modern and historical buildings in three major municipalities of Crete (Heraklion, Chania, and Rethymno) using ambient noise recordings (microtremors) considering the importance of soil-structure interaction to seismic structural response, particularly for historical buildings and monumental structures. In this study, ambient noise recordings have been processed through Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratios (H/V) to preliminarily examine the main frequencies and to examine whether the building has its main frequency close to that of the soil in order to identify potential resonance phenomena. Numerous ambient noise recordings were recorded on the soil, in the basement, and at each n-floor of the buildings. The incorporation of local site conditions and soil-building resonance phenomena into the urban planning development of Crete regarding earthquake risk assessments is necessary. In this direction, microtremors can be used as an effective tool to support civil protection preparation and operational decision-making in terms of earthquake disaster, specifically in the area of Crete, which is characterized by high seismic activity and a high cultural monuments capacity.

J	Qi, L; Li, J; Wang, Y; Gao, XB				Qi, Lin; Li, Jie; Wang, Ying; Gao, Xinbo			Urban Observation: Integration of Remote Sensing and Social Media Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Remote sensing; Urban areas; Monitoring; Sensors; Big Data; Flickr; Big data; remote sensing; social media; urban observation	BIG DATA; LAND-USE; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; FLOOD; INFORMATION; IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; LOCATION	Urban and regional research is crucial for many applications such as public participation, land use, disaster management, and environmental monitoring, but it is a time-consuming and expensive procedure to collect necessary data. Remote sensing is an effective technology for urban observation, however, the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of observation sensors limits many situations in which remote sensing data cannot be fully utilized, especially in the field of urban observation. Recently, with the popularity of internet and smart mobile devices, social media containing spatial information is evolving rapidly, such as tweets, Flickr photos, and geolocated posts. These location-based social media data are leading new research areas, new technologies and methods, and new insights into urban observation. In this paper, we provide an overview on the integration and joint analysis of remote sensing and social media data in urban observation applications. We describe four opportunities in exploiting social media data: to investigate the relationship among humans, environment and urban, to help urban planning, to manage urban disaster, and to monitor urban environment. Although significant possibilities for a combination of remote sensing and social media data can be seen, our survey suggests that the fusion of these data sources will continue to profoundly change these technologies.

To provide shelter for people within a reasonable evacuation distance under day and night disaster scenarios, we formed an approach for examining the distribution of day and night shelter demand at the plot-scale using point of interest (POI) data, and then analyzed the supply and demand status of shelters after an evacuation simulation built in Python programming language. Taking the downtown areas of Guangzhou, China as a case study, the results show that significant differences exist in the size and spatial distribution of shelter demand in daytime and nighttime, and the total demand is 7.929 million people, which is far larger than the resident population. The average evacuation time of all 16,883 routes is 12.6 min, and after the evacuation, 558 of 888 shelters exceed their capacity to varying degrees, accounting for 62.84% of the total, indicating that the shelters cannot completely receive the potential evacuees. The method proposed in this paper provides a direct quantitative basis for the number and size of new shelter resources being planned during urban renewal activities, and form a reference for land reuse and disaster prevention space organization in future urban planning.

J	Cremen, G; Galasso, C; McCloskey, J				Cremen, Gemma; Galasso, Carmine; McCloskey, John			A Simulation-Based Framework for Earthquake Risk-Informed and People-Centered Decision Making on Future Urban Planning	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article							GROUND-MOTION PREDICTION; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; SEISMIC VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRAGILITY FUNCTIONS; DISASTER RISK; INFRASTRUCTURE; BUILDINGS; EXPANSION; EXPOSURE	Numerous approaches to earthquake risk modeling and quantification have already been proposed in the literature and/or are well established in practice. However, most of these procedures are designed to focus on risk in the context of current static exposure and vulnerability, and are therefore limited in their ability to support decisions related to the future, as yet partially unbuilt, urban landscape. We propose an end-toend risk modeling framework that explicitly addresses this specific challenge. The framework is designed to consider the earthquake (ground-shaking) risks of tomorrow's urban environment, using a simulation-based approach to rigorously capture the uncertainties inherent in future projections of exposure as well as physical and social vulnerability. The framework also advances the state-of-practice in future disaster risk modeling by additionally: (a) providing a harmonized methodology for integrating physical and social impacts of disasters that facilitates flexible characterization of risk metrics beyond physical damage/asset losses; and (b) incorporating a participatory, people-centered approach to risk-informed decision making. The framework is showcased using the physical and social environment of an expanding synthetic city. This example application demonstrates how the framework may be used to make policy decisions related to future urban areas, based on multiple, uncertain risk drivers.

This circumstance could get worse, taking into account climate change effects. The literature points out different adaptation measures to minimize the possible increasing effects caused by climate change. Among them is the improvement of the vulnerability of a transport network and Emergency Management Systems. The effective management of emergencies is of vital importance to minimize the potential damage resulting from a catastrophe. Given such circumstances, analysis of the vulnerability of networks is a technique whose results highlight deficiencies and serve as support for future decisions concerning the transformation of the network or the installation of new emergency centers. The main objective of this research is to highlight the vulnerability of the road network in a variety of multi-contingency scenarios related to flooding and to identify the optimal location for a new emergency management center based on that analysis. The results obtained could be used in urban planning tasks to improve the resilience of urban areas in the face of an increase in flood episodes caused by climate change.

In this paper we review social media analysis approaches and its' application areas by sampling and reviewing studies from IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and SpringerLink. The primary focus of this paper is on the role of social media data in extracting, tracking, and evaluating general public activities, public opinions, and public behaviour. We look at several application areas, including disaster, urban planning, public health, politics, business, and marketing. The frequently used approaches in these areas are topic analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, spatial and temporal analysis. Moreover, this study provides insight for those who wish to learn about social media's role as a data source for research related to our real-world issues and events.

While several change detection approaches have been proposed to deal with growing urban areas, their performances are usually limited due to outliers in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). In this study, in order to discriminate urban growth from the other changes, we exploit spatial connectivity of the changed pixels. To do so, we first stack SITS to a single synthetic image whose pixel values denote the temporal variability along the series. Then, we propose to rely on efficient and well-established spatial filtering by means of the max-tree image representation, leading to a novel approach for detecting changes in urban areas, and more precisely focusing on the spatial extent of such changes in relationship with the urban growth. Experimental results obtained on Landsat imagery of Dar es Salaam showed that our approach helps to remove outliers from the change map and provides satisfactory accuracy.

Because of the advantages of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which is not affected by time, weather or other conditions, change-detection technology based on SAR images has important research value. At present, this technology has attracted the attention of increasingly more researchers, and has also been used extensively in diverse fields, such as urban planning, disaster assessment, and forest early warning systems. Our objective in this paper is to combine both the change detection of SAR images with the deep neural networks to compare its efficiency with fuzzy clustering method and deep belief network. Our experiments, conducted on real data sets and theoretical analysis, indicates the advantages of the proposed method. Our results appear that proposed deep-learning algorithms can further improve the change-detection process.

Not only for research and survey but also for disaster mitigation and urban planning even for film. One way to acquire geographic data is to use an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). With UAVs we can acquire geographic maps quickly without having to drive around the site. UAV is currently one of the global technologies but, UAVs have several disadvantages where one of them is the length of flight time which is very dependent on the electrical energy of the battery, while the site used for research sometimes reaches hundreds of hectares. In this study, we will discuss the case and try to solve the problem by using solar cells to provide longer flight times for UAVs. This research will help land surveyors to improve the quality of their performance.

Big Data Challenges in Airborne Hyperspectral Image for Urban Landuse Classification	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATICS (ICACCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	SEP 13-16, 2017	Manipal, INDIA				LIDAR DATA; FUSION	In recent years, it was a difficult task to classify a huge set of data due to the increasing population in urban places. As of now, satellite hyperspectral image provides information but this is not sufficient to classify data in urban areas. To develop the urban areas, accurate and timely information is necessary for the government. Hence, airborne hyperspectral data provides sufficient information for urban planning and disaster management. This paper, focuses on the following objectives: (i) To improve the classification accuracy in bigdata images (ii) To reduce the mixed pixels in residential buildings that are surrounded by small trees (iii) To bring down similar pixels of roads and parking lots.

The digital models, even if they refer to the terrain or to the surface, have an important role in ecosystems analysis projects, regional or national urban planning, sustainable resource management and natural disaster prevention. When we talk about digital elevation modeling in the context of sustainable development, we refer primarily to the applicability of the three-dimensional description of the space around us. An important aspect of DEM in terms of sustainable development is the way that it is obtained, so that the resources consumption for its generation to be minimal and the applicability for large scale. This paper presents the major domains of DEM applicability in the context of sustainable development, and also aspects regarding an efficient way of generating DEMs. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we examine the feasibility of extracting building height information using computer vision algorithms with Structure from Motion procedures (SfM) from overlapping airborne images in urban environment. 3D land surface models can be generated from airborne images, and then DTM is subtracted from the DSM to form the nDSM layer. Using object-based image analysis, building height can be differentiated from bush, trees, and others by rulesets of spectral features, geometric features and contextual information. The accuracy of the building height based on orthorectified images and nDSM from airborne imagery was at a similar level to those based on airborne LiDAR data from the same study area.

The method used was the inductive one, with the analysis of the laws pertinent to the studied case and documents previously selected, as well as a field study in the units of conservation analyzed. The present study is important to reflect on concrete actions in the preservation of ecosystems, assuming that if the management model is verified, it will be possible to have a positive repercussion between the maintenance of species of animals, plants, water sources, springs, whether surface or underground and the prevention of disasters, which is a wide range of ecological services that will directly benefit human life.

Detection and Extraction of Roads using Cartosat-2 High Resolution Satellite Imagery	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE AND GRAPHICS PROCESSING (ICIGP 2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Image and Graphics Processing (ICIGP)	FEB 08-10, 2020	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Tokyo City Univ, Kogakuin Univ, IACSIT, Alma Mater Studorium		GIS; cartosat-2 dataset; image processing; line segment detector; morphological operations		The extraction of roads from panchromatic images has many insightful applications in the fields of urban planning, setting up of transportation, disaster management and cartography in geographical information systems (GIS). The process of extracting roads from high-resolution images is composite, due to the presence of different noises (i.e., buildings, shadows, clouds etc.). Various image processing techniques and various quality measures are applied on the high-resolution remote sensing satellite images to improve the quality of the image and interactively extract the information of roads. Cartosat-2 images available in Bhuvan website of ISRO are taken for testing the validity of proposed method. The proposed method enhances the images using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Line Detector for detecting road segments. Connected component analysis (CCA) is performed on segmented image for connection of disconnected objects in the segmented image. Morphological operations fill the holes caused by the presence of shadows, buildings and trees on the road surface.	[Vani, K. Suvarna; Kumar, K.

The article is situated in a case study of flood and climate risk governance in Canada's Metro Vancouver region. Drawing on 60 interviews with emergency managers, engineers, planners, and elected officials, and a regional survey of resilience practitioners, we identify distinct knowledge systems used for managing urban resilience. We find that technical hazard- and engineering-based knowledge that has maintained its supremacy over the past decades is being increasingly challenged through knowledge co-production. We find that formalized and shadow spaces for learning and collaborative problem-solving break down barriers and enable a collective search for flood resilience solutions across governance levels.

The idea is to let teams of users marshal, analyze, collaborate and act on all of the available information about a situation playing out over space and time. Teams can rapidly assemble a custom repository of geographic information about a region, bi-directionally link it to collections of document gathered from the World-Wide-Web or other specialized information spaces, and monitor events that might effect decisions made on the basis of this rich information set. This functionality is provided within a framework that enables synchronous and asynchronous collaboration over finding, filtering and organizing a collection of information and presents the relevant geographic information in a rich 3D (VRML) visualization environment.

Data of the soil type, land use and cover, relief, climate, and flow were used. The calibration and validation of the models were performed based on the historical fluviometric series of the station located in the basin. The statistical indices Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, deviation percentage, and the standard deviation of the observations were used to evaluate the models. According to the obtained indices, both software systems were satisfactorily able to simulate the flow. Under the conditions of this study, SWAT was superior to HEC-HMS and statistically more adequate for future predictions in the basin. SWAT presented a greater potential for use by management bodies and urban planning in the management of the risks of extreme hydrological events.

Change detection in remote sensing images is an active research area in applications such as disaster management, urban planning etc. Texture is an important characteristic which can be used to identify various objects or regions in an image. Texture features along with spectral and morphological operators have been shown to have a positive impact on the accuracy of change detection in remote sensing images. Haralick, 1973 defined a set of twenty eight texture features which can be extracted from any image on a block basis. This paper explores the effectiveness of various texture features in enhancing the accuracy of change detection process. In this paper we have used three sets of texture features and their impact has been analyzed, keeping all other parameters constant.

J	Yuan, XH; Sarma, V				Yuan, Xiaohui; Sarma, Vaibhav			Automatic Urban Water-Body Detection and Segmentation From Sparse ALSM Data via Spatially Constrained Model-Driven Clustering	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Image segmentation; sparse matrices; unsupervised learning; urban areas	LIDAR; INTEGRATION	Identifying hydrological features is important for urban planning and disaster assessment. Data spatial resolution poses challenges in automatic processing. In this letter, we present a novel spatially constrained model-driven clustering method that automatically detects and delineates water bodies in an urban area using airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM) data and imagery. Our method analyzes the modality of the sparseness histogram to decide the existence of water body, followed by clustering. Using the sparseness, clusters are decided by selecting candidate sites. In the iteration of clustering process, new sites are recruited within a close spatial vicinity of the boundary sites. Experiments were conducted using data sets from the city of New Orleans. Our method demonstrated superior robustness regardless of the density of ALSM sample and data discrepancy and very competitive accuracy in comparison with manual tracing, with an overall accuracy above 98%.

J	Vargas, J; Olcina, J; Paneque, P				Vargas, Jesus; Olcina, Jorge; Paneque, Pilar			Flood risk mapping in territorial planning for disaster risk management. Scales of work and case studies in Spain	EURE-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ESTUDIOS URBANO REGIONALES			Spanish	Article						natural risks; spatial planning; vulnerability	VULNERABILITY; MAPS	Flood risk causes the major socio-economic losses in the Spanish Mediterranean coast. As a result of a misalignment of land use policies and practices, which have not considered floods hazard sufficiently, the increase in the frequency of floods due to climate change, exposure and vulnerability have increased in last decades. Territorial planning is a key tool to promote preventive risk management, and risk mapping is the key piece for decision making at the different geographical scales of land use planning. This paper presents a systematic multi-scale analysis of risk map treatment in territorial planning instruments at different scales, and analyzes the degree of linkage between them. The analysis has been carried out in two case studies in Spain (Valencian Community and Andalusia). Results show that the use of flood risk mapping continues to pose important challenges, especially in urban planning documents, and in relation to vulnerability assessment.

The purpose of this research work is to evaluate 3D reconstruction of urban scenes by using a work flow given by commercial off-the-shelf software, such as the optional IMAGINE UAV module for ERDAS IMAGINE 2016. Digital elevation models and point clouds were extracted from RGB aerial images, which were captured by two SVS-Vistek nadir cameras with a resolution of 16 megapixel. The cameras were synchronized with a GPS/INS module for a direct georeferencing of the images. Additionally, the generated 3D models were imported to the Agisoft PhotoScan application for a better visualization and to verify the focal length of the camera. The Tridicon BuildingFinder software was used to improve the quality of the generated point clouds and for building recognition as well.

This paper is devoted to the issue of 3D modelling at different spatial extents and levels of detail. Theoretical section summarizes a review of data formats, software and web technologies used for the 3D visualization of geographical data. X3DOM library has been chosen for the implementation of several 3D visualizations. Different input data and software were used for each of these use cases. The individual processing methods were compared with each other. Possibilities of implementation of interactive functions in X3DOM library and their utilization in educational materials for the teaching geography were also described in detail. Advantages, limits and future development of the proposed concepts are discussed in the conclusions.

J	Barrios, RE				Barrios, Roberto E.			"If You Did Not Grow Up Here, You Cannot Appreciate Living Here": Neoliberalism, Space-time, and Affect in Post-Katrina Recovery Planning	HUMAN ORGANIZATION			English	Article						disaster reconstruction; urban planning; neoliberalism; New Orleans	NEW-ORLEANS	In post-Katrina New Orleans, local government officials have represented neighborhood recovery planning as a mechanism of shared governance, where all residents can participate as collective authors of the city's reconstruction directive. In these representations, expert planners were described as professional facilitators who served the primary role of documenting and giving a common format to resident ideas about urban recovery. Contrary to these official representations, this article shows how neighborhood recovery planning for the city's centrally located 4th planning district was characterized by significant tensions between professional planners' visions of urban development and resident notions of neighborhood and community. The article makes the case that the anthropological literature on the social production of space, time, and affect provides us with a resourceful vantage point for understanding what is at stake in the different ways New Orleanians and professional planners envisioned urban recovery and offers analytical resources for negotiating these differences.

Flood risk assessment (FRA) is moving towards an approach that encompasses social, climatic, and environmental changes. Advances in climate and hydraulic modelling allow the development of long-term scenarios with greater reliability. However, the coupling of human behaviour in the process of flood risk assessment is still in an embryonic phase. Here we attempt to fill this gap by (1) coupling a socio-hydrological model with an urban flood model using a cellular automata approach, and (2) using climate change projections to estimate flood risk in the coming decades. We illustrate our analytical framework with an application in a Brazilian catchment, showing its potential in developing long-term scenarios that can ultimately improve the process of flood risk assessment.

It is tedious to manually pre-program each agent's actions, its interactions with other agents and with the environment. Simulation is a good approach in this kind of domain since complex global behaviors emerge from the local interactions. We simulate a crowd movement using a multi-agent approach where each agent is situated in the virtual environment. An agent can perceive and interact with other agents and with the environment. Complex behaviors emerging from these interactions are from local rules and without any central control. These behaviors reveal the complexity of the domain without explicitly programming the system. In this work, we investigate (i) the navigation of the agents and (ii) the corresponding animations of each agent's behaviors. Simulation results under different parameters are presented and discussed.

The days of high temperature and heat waves became increasingly obvious. Therefore, this paper aimed to reveal the temporal changes in high temperature and heat waves and analyze the relevant disasters. The results showed that the duration and average high temperature were both increasing during 1951-2013. Days of heat waves were mainly concentrated in August. The longest duration of extreme heat was in 2013 lasting 9 days. The major issues caused by high temperature and heat waves were energy consumption, power shortage, human health and human habitat deterioration. Land use change driven by human activities altered the underlying surface and accelerated urban heat island effect. These views provide scientific evidence for assisting urban planning and industrial restructuring in the future.

It can quickly acquire three-dimensional (3D) geographic coordinate information of ground surface and ground targets, and has typical advantage in such applications as urban planning, 3D modeling, disaster assessment, etc. This paper presents an extraction method for interested buildings using three-dimensional laser point cloud data which are filtered and organized by the kd tree. First, the algorithm determines candidate points of a building from non-ground points and clusters them on the constraints of distance so that single building target can be segmented. Second, for each segmented building target, the algorithm extracts its edge points and regularizes its edge. The extracted building feature information is provided for quickly searching target of interest. At last, the method is proved to be effective based on the analysis of measured data. The method is no point cloud interpolation error, and is not affected by the size or shape of a building.

However, remote sensing imaging links such as atmosphere, platform and optical system seriously affect the ability of image interpretation and analysis. The traditional regularized processing methods have a strong ability to improve the definition, but most of them may sacrifice texture details or introduce artifacts, because their fixed prior parameters cannot fully adapt to various kinds of scenes. To address this problem, we propose a novel fine-processing method based on the adaptive hyper-Laplacian prior for remote sensing imaging systems. The method is developed by automatically updating and optimizing the prior parameters and objective function in the iterative process based on the prior characteristics of different regions of remote sensing images. Experimentally, the proposed method can realize the fine-processing of remote sensing images, including the edge enhancement, texture detail preservation, and artifact suppression.

J	Bankoff, G				Bankoff, Greg			Under the Volcano: Mount Mayon and Co-Volcanic Societies in the Philippines	ENVIRONMENT AND HISTORY			English	Article						Co-volcanic societies; volcanoes; Mount Mayon; Philippines		Rich volcanic soils have long attracted human settlements, which have traded the risk of eruption against the benefits of higher agricultural yields. Yet little research has been done on how societies have normalised the risks and adapted to living in proximity to volcanoes, or how those modifications, in turn, might have influenced the effects of eruptions and their consequent hazards. In short, people have co-evolved with volcanoes to create 'co-volcanic societies'. By looking closely at the Philippines and focusing on one region of southern Luzon around Mount Mayon, this article addresses the question of how people and the volcano have 'co-adapted' to living in proximity to one another over time. It also suggests that to make societies more resilient to volcanic hazards, a better understanding of this relationship is required not only to improve current disaster risk reduction policies but even to inform everyday urban planning and civil engineering decisions.

It examines the perceptions of both market-stall occupants and primary stakeholders regarding the hazard of fire, and analyses the availability of local assets (coping strategies) with which to address the challenge. Through an evaluation of past instances of fire, as well as in-depth key stakeholder interviews, field visits, and observations, the study produces a detailed hazard map of the market. It goes on to recommend that policymakers consider short-to-long-term interventions to reduce the degree of risk. By foregrounding the essence of holistic and integrated planning, the paper calls for the incorporation of disaster mitigation measures in the overall urban planning process and for the strict enforcement of relevant building and fire safety codes by responsible public agencies.

J	Yap, KS				Yap, Kioe Sheng			The enabling strategy and its discontent: Low-income housing policies and practices in Asia	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Low income housing policies; Asia; Enabling strategy; Real esate development	SETTLEMENTS	Over the past few decades, Asia's urbanization has been driven by rapid economic growth, while also making economic growth possible. These developments have allowed millions of people to escape income poverty and led to the emergence of an expanding middle class. Its ambition for home ownership and its paying capacity, reinforced by a vibrant housing finance sector and supported by enabling housing policies, have motivated private-sector real estate developers to supply housing affordable for large sections of the urban population. This has improved housing conditions in urban areas. However, like elsewhere, free-market economic policies have also resulted in growing income and access inequalities between those with the entrepreneurial spirit, knowledge and skills to seize new economic opportunities, and those who, for various reasons, have not been able to do so. So, despite economic growth, the demand for informal housing has not declined. At the same time, globalization and foreign direct investments have increased development pressure on urban land, as investors see real estate as a safe investment. The housing problems of the urban low-income population cannot be solved unless the urban poor have access to urban land, but this requires urban planning and government intervention in the urban land market. Most governments are unwilling to do this, as it runs counter to their free-market economic policies. Urban planning, within a free-market economy, is critical, not only to address the low-income housing shortage, but also the impacts of climate change, two issues which converge in the future of informal settlements in the disaster-prone coastal areas of the Asia Pacific region.

The recent Wenchuan and Jiuzhaigou earthquakes have increased the amount of source material available in these debris flow gullies, and the disturbed nature of the slopes makes them prone to failure under high rainfall, increasing the risk of large-scale debris flows. Moreover, poor urban planning in the region may multiply the human and economic losses caused by debris flows. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the potential hazard zones associated with such debris flows and to implement debris flow hazard and risk assessment. In this paper, Niwan gully is chosen as the study object, as it is characterized by repeated debris flow outbreaks and an ill-considered urban planning at the outlet of the gully. A depth-integrated continuum method is adopted to determine the potential hazard zones of debris flows with different recurrence intervals. The debris flow inundation and evolutionary trajectory are shown to be reasonably comparable with historical debris flows. A two-factor model that couples maximum flow depth with momentum is used to better classify the hazard zones. This study also provides a complete and efficient means to determine the values of debris flow parameters and to implement a hazard and risk assessment based on the solid material reserve method and a probabilistic method.

The consequence of the sustainable development implementation is a necessity of spatial system designing. This means that ensuring sustainable development presumes different Geographic Information Systems (GIS) because they give quick access of updating and analysing spatial databases. This paper presents the updating conception of the urban GIS database for Timisoara municipality, using knowledge from different sources of cadastre and GIS. It also highlights the connection that should be taken into consideration between the general cadastre and the specialty cadastres represented by the fact that the technical and economical inventorying of the network utilities must start from the primary information given by general cadastre, referring to parcel, area and land-use category. The importance of the paper lies in its role as an efficient management tool for a huge amount of spatial urban relevant data thus contributing to the optimization of the activity carried on by the local administrations. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in 3D (three-dimensional) technology which can be seen also by major cities developing 3-dimensional models, and global technology companies developing solutions to capture, display and manipulate this type of data. Accurate cartographic feature extraction, map updating, digital city models and 3D city models in urban areas are essential for many applications, such as mapping of buildings and their heights, simulation of new buildings, military operations, disaster management, updating and keeping cadastral databases current, and also for virtual reality.

Since the 1990s, post-disaster reconstruction has often been seen as an opportunity to invest in new projects following market forces and property speculation rather than for implementing rehabilitation strategies to address physical, social and psychological effects. Housing subsidies provided by the government seem to be a new issue creating more social disparity in the case of Talca, Chile after the 2010 magnitude 8.8 earthquake. This paper explores the contemporary urban landscape of this intermediate city, shaped between 2010 and 2016, which shows a great number of empty plots being filled by gated community typologies. By using ethnography and semi-structured interviews of residents from four historic neighbourhoods, the results show key patterns of physical and social change such as displacement of original residents by newcomers and lack of social cohesion along with tensions among them. The case of the Talca, Chile reconstruction is educational for understanding the ways in which many inner cities are affected by reconstruction policies with property speculation and gentrification effects. This paper concludes with the criteria that are being applied to redesign historic neighbourhoods and provides reflections for improving urban planning mechanisms to include both original residents and newcomers who are sharing these historic neighbourhoods.

Analysis of human exposure to landslides with a GIS multiscale approach	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Disaster risk reduction; Landslide probability; Logistic regression; Landslide trigger factors; GIS model; Global map	GLOBAL LANDSLIDE; SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT; RAINFALL THRESHOLDS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; NATURAL HAZARDS; REGION; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; DISASTER	Decision-making plays a key role in reducing landslide risk and preventing natural disasters. Land management, recovery of degraded lands, urban planning, and environmental protection in general are fundamental for mitigating landslide hazard and risk. Here, we present a GIS-based multi-scale approach to highlight where and when a country is affected by a high probability of landslide occurrence. In the first step, a landslide human exposure equation is developed considering the landslide susceptibility triggered by rain as hazard, and the population density as exposed factor. The output, from this overview analysis, is a global GIS layer expressing the number of potentially affected people by month, where the monthly rain is used to weight the landslide hazard. As following step, Logistic Regression (LR) analysis was implemented at a national and local level. The Receiver Operating Characteristic indicator is used to understand the goodness of a LR model. The LR models are defined by a dependent variable, presence-absence of landslide points, versus a set of independent environmental variables. The results demonstrate the relevance of a multi-scale approach, at national level the biophysical variables are able to detect landslide hotspot areas, while at sub-regional level geomorphological aspects, like land cover, topographic wetness, and local climatic condition have greater explanatory power.

Yet, the governance of Volcanic River Basins (VRB) remains vastly unexplored. There are at least 500 active volcanoes worldwide, with 600 million people living near them. Through a multiple-case study methodology, we aim to contribute to the understanding of how lahar risks management is being conducted in two distinct urbanized volcanic river basins: Yogyakarta in Indonesia, and Latacunga in Ecuador. Both are located in the "ring of fire" with recent eruption threats in the last decade. The two cases were conducted independently, both triangulated by international and national literature reviews, policy analysis, and in-depth interviews. The Indonesian case study focuses on the governance intricacies for water and disaster management after 2010 eruption during pre, onset, and post-eruption. The Ecuadorian case study looks at risk governance from the perspective of households after a volcanic eruption in 2015, highlighting how bottom-up risk management strategies interact with top-down governance policies. Based on both case studies, a synthesis framework for Volcanic River Basin Management (VRBM) is formulated. This framework can be used as the way forward to analyze disaster and resources management in urbanized volcanic areas.

J	Zhang, JZ; Srivastava, PR; Eachempati, P				Zhang, Justin Zuopeng; Srivastava, Praveen Ranjan; Eachempati, Prajwal			Evaluating the effectiveness of drones in emergency situations: a hybrid multi-criteria approach	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						Drones; Fuzzy AHP; Best-Worst; Fuzzy ANP; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Disaster		Purpose The paper aims to build a customized hybrid multi-criteria model to identify the top three utilities of drones at both personal and community levels for two use cases: firefighting in high-rise buildings and logistic support. Design/methodology/approach A hybrid multi-criterion model that integrates fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP), Best Worst, fuzzy analytical network process (ANP), fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is used to compute the criteria weights. The weights are validated by a novel ensemble ranking technique further whetted by experts at the community and personal levels to two use cases. Findings Drones' fire handling and disaster recovery utilities are the most important to fight fire in high-rise buildings at both personal and community levels. Similarly, drones' urban planning, municipal works and infrastructure inspection utilities are the most important for providing logistics support at personal and community levels. Originality/value The paper presents a novel multi-criteria approach, i.e. ensemble ranking, by combining the criteria ranking of individual methods - fuzzy AHP, Best-Worst, fuzzy ANP and fuzzy DEMATEL - in the ratio of optimal weights to each technique to generate the consolidated ranking. Domain experts also validate this ranking for robustness. This paper demonstrates a viable methodology to quantify the utilities of drones and their capabilities. The proposed model can be recalibrated for different use case scenarios of drones.

Over the years it has been seen that such events have occurred at shorter intervals and with greater impacts caused. Due to these impacts, it was necessary to study the environmental, social and managerial dynamics of this municipality. This article aims to identify the best option within the established alternatives to assist in determining priorities for flood risk management in the municipality. The used methodology was the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), with the use of four indicators for the disasters preparedy by Cardona et al. (2005): Risk Identification, Risk Reduction, Disaster Management, and Governance and Financial Protection. Those indicators were selected according to the judgments issued by the municipal civil defense coordinator. According to the main results from AHP for Risk Identification, should be prioritized for implementation, in descending order: monitors of threats and prognosis (29,6%); public information and community participation (22,4%); and, systematic inventory of disasters and losses (19,3%). For Risk Reduction: integration of risk in defining land use and urban planning (35,7%); intervention and environmental protection of river basins (19,2%). For Disaster Management: organization and coordination of emergency operations (35,2%); preparation and training community (17,2%); and, response planning in emergency case and warning systems (16,9%). And for Governance and Financial Protection: interagency organization, of multiple sectors and decentralized (28,7%); location and resource mobilization and budget (20,7%); and, network deployments and social security funds (15,9%). From the results obtained, it is concluded that the sequence established by the methodology should be implemented by public managers, to have a flood risk management more efficient in the municipality.

Africa is particularly vulnerable at preset as, since 2005, the highest rates of rapid urbanization-associated forest degradation have occurred there. On August 14, 2017, a compound geohazard in Freetown, Sierra Leone, caused thousands of fatalities and destroyed hundreds of houses. Land use change is considered the main factor contributing to geohazard initiation. Here, we use Freetown as a case study to quantitatively assess the magnitude of the increase in ecological risk associated with land use changes. To achieve the aim, satellite images are used in the case study area from 2007 to 2017, the data are integrated into a geographic information system. A series of indices are then used based on the processed images to describe land use and ecological risk, including dynamic index, trend and state index, and ecological risk index. The results show that Freetown experienced a rapid urbanization process, together with an unbalanced increase in urban land and complex conversion of bare and grass land, from 2007 to 2017. Significantly degenerated forest was converted into urban land (2.77%), bare land (6.47%), and grassland (10.27%), while the ecological risk level increased from low to high. The ecological risk in the affected area of geohazard is found higher than that of the surrounding mountainous area. It indicates that vegetation may reduce the risk of disaster. This result is helpful for the trade-off between urban development and ecological protection and rational urban planning. For disaster resilience and sustainable development of Freetown, and also other rapidly urbanizing cities in mountainous areas, ecological protection must be incorporated into development planning.

J	Hayward, BM				Hayward, Bronwyn Mary			Rethinking Resilience: Reflections on the Earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand, 2010 and 2011	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						citizenship; earthquake; political agency; resilience; social justice	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE	Resilience has emerged as a policy response in an era of public concern about disasters and risks that include fear of terrorism and environmental or economic catastrophe. Resilience is both a refreshing and a problematic concept. It is refreshing in that it creates new opportunities for interdisciplinary research and vividly reminds us that the material world matters in our social lives, political economy, and urban planning. However, the concept of resilience is also problematic. Widespread, uncritical calls for greater resilience in response to environmental, economic, and social challenges often obscure significant questions of political power. In particular, we may ask, resilience of what, and for whom? My reflection here was written in the context of the ongoing grief, disruption, and community protest in my home city of Christchurch, New Zealand, a city that experienced 59 earthquakes of magnitude 5 or more, and over 3800 aftershocks of magnitude 3 or greater between September 2010 and September 2012. From this perspective, I call for expanding our political imagination about resilience, to include ideas of compassion and political resistance. In my observation, both compassion, expressed as shared vulnerability, and resistance, experienced as community mobilization against perceived injustice, have been vital elements of grassroots community recovery.

A novel semi-supervised multiscale change detection method based on online learning framework is presented in this paper. Firstly, mean-variance classifier and SVM classifier are trained at the different scales of 2*2 pixels block and original pixel respectively. Initial training set is extracted from the ground truth. Secondly, the difference image is obtained according to two phase remote sensing images, and arranged by the unit of 16*16 pixel block. Image blocks are input into the mean-variance classifier and SVM classier to be detected one by one, it is cascade connection between two classifiers. The error correction rules are used to choose the mis-classified instances to retrain the classifiers. Experiment results show that the method in this paper can efficiently decrease the FN (false negative numbers) to improve the performance of change detection algorithm.

J	Bektas, Y; Sakarya, A				Bektas, Yasin; Sakarya, Adem			An Evaluation of an Integrated Disaster Management and an Emergency Assembly Area: The Case of Kadikoy, Istanbul	ICONARP INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING			English	Article						Disaster risk; emergency assembly area; integrated disaster management; network analysis; urban planning	GIS	Purpose The present study aims to analyze the accessibility and adequacy of the emergency assembly areas (EAAs) in Kadikoy which has the highest ratio of at-risk buildings in Istanbul. Design/Methodology/Approach In this study, accessibility and adequacy of the EAAs are analyzed. To analyze the accessibility network analysis carried out within a geographic information system (GIS) program is used. Through an accessibility analysis, the ratio of the population that resides within 500 m walking distance of each EEA was ascertained. Furthermore, an adequacy analysis was carried out to measure the size of each emergency assembly area, and its adequacy for the population within its catchment area was analyzed. In addition, an accessibility and adequacy analysis were made of the social infrastructure facilities that have been defined as second-level emergency assembly areas. Findings According to the research findings, 57 percent of the current population of the district resides within 500 m of one or more of Kachkoy's 73 EEAs. It was found also that the emergency assembly areas accessible by three-quarters of the population within 500 m could be considered inadequate. Based on these findings, it was concluded that emergency assembly areas should be of adequate size, away from disaster risks and accessible to all residents, and that the standards for the open and closed areas within the emergency assembly areas should be defined in legislation and included as mandatory in future plans. Research Limitations/Implications The research was limited to Kadikoy which has the highest ratio of at-risk buildings in Istanbul. Originality/Value When evaluated alongside relevant studies regarding EAAs, the present study can be said to contribute to literature in its analysis of both the accessibility and adequacy of the existing EAAs and secondary assembly areas, taking a holistic approach, the study makes use of a network analysis method in the GIS program to identify the number of people living in each residential structure within the Kadikoy district. In addition, the study seeks to contribute further to literature by measuring the accessibility of social and technical infrastructure within the city planning discipline through a network analysis.

Taking jinan city as an example, this paper analyzed the causes from planning view.One is the absence of traffic environmental bearing capacity in traffic planning;The second is the lack of sufficient attention to ventilation channel planning;The third is unreasonable layout of industrial land. In order to solve these problems, one hand, we should put forward some city planning countermeasures, such as developing public transit system and paying more attention to bicycle lane and sidewalk planning. On the other hand, it is evitable that automobile possession will increase with economy development, so we should pay more attention on roadway and river course ventilation planning, they are helpful for contaminant spreading by forming an atmosphere favorable to emission diffusion. Moreover industrial land should be laid in upstream of minimum wind frequency and downstream of maximum wind frequency. By these means the fog and haze weather can be controlled to some extent.

LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Pandemic; COVID-19; Resilience; Cooperation; Cities; Urban economy; Health policy; Design institutes; Smart City; Urban planning		Chinese cities have been placed upon lockdown in early 2020 in an attempt to contain the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), as increasingly huge demands are being placed upon Chinese and international health professionals to address this pandemic. Surprisingly, planning and design professionals are absent in the discourses about existing and post COVID-19 strategies and actions even though previous pandemics historically revealed major impacts on the urban fabric from social and economic perspectives. This paper is a call for action for international architectural and urban organisations to include pandemics and similar in their disaster management strategies. This need is very evident in their need to better design creative and relevant protocols in partnership with health discipine organisations, and so that their applied deployment in pandemic stricken cities can be effected integrated seamlessly within normal city environment planning activities and also in incident situations like containing the current COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the present-day technologies are struggling when handling huge volumes of data coming from growing network of IoT devices, especially with regards to the variety of used data formats and data velocity (periodicity). Increasing data saturation demands more efficient processing, but also provides possibilities with regards to higher interactivity of GIS applications. These current trends push GIS towards more dynamic solutions that can be more readily deployed. This is also evidenced by the increasing abandonment of classic software models and shift towards utilization of cloud-based solutions. The newly developed application models face many obstacles in terms of high demand on processing automation and scalability. The paper outlines several of these issue areas and discusses solutions that are currently being deployed or developed.

Urban areas, which are densely developed with huge levels of population and infrastructure, are critical places to develop adaptation and resilience strategies. This study aims to conceptualize evolutionary urban climate resilience strategies with a step-by-step analytic framework that will be called 3R: Recognition-Readiness-Response. Design/methodology/approach - This analytic framework is then applied to assess whether and to what extent the components of urban climate resilience are incorporated into the pertinent ordinances and policies of the Seoul Metropolitan Government, including climate change, urban planning and disaster management. Findings - The findings of this study suggest that the climate change ordinances of Seoul have focused on climate mitigation rather than resilience. Practical implications - Thus, comprehensive efforts are required to incorporate evolutionary urban climate resilience strategies into ordinances and practices. Originality/value - This paper contributes to build an analytic framework that provides a step-by-step process with check-list questions based on the sub-components of urban climate resilience procedure.

J	CASTANOS, H; LOMNITZ, C				CASTANOS, H; LOMNITZ, C			UNPLANNED AND UNFORESEEN EFFECTS OF INSTABILITIES IN THE NATURE-SOCIETY SYSTEM AS POSSIBLE CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKE DISASTERS	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						DISASTERS; INSTABILITY; MEXICO EARTHQUAKE		The nature-society system is proposed as the relevant analytical unit for the sociological study of disasters. Like other complex systems, this system has emergent properties: its instabilities are the disasters. They often arise as a result of adoption by a community of specific technologies, e.g., housing technologies, that turn out to be unstable in the presence of critical natural or social changes. The following earthquake disasters were caused by unplanned and unforeseen features of housing or siting technologies: Huaxian 1556 (caves in loess), Yungay 1970 (siting in the path of an avalanche), and Mexico 1985 (high-rise buildings on soft ground). Disasters have an archaeology, in the sense that the instabilities in the nature-society system are not static. This is demonstrated by tracing the 1985 Mexico earthquake disaster back to decisions on urban planning taken after 1521. It is not enough to know the hazard and the vulnerability in order to understand disasters. Technological solutions also have a local history.

J	Wamsler, C; Lawson, N				Wamsler, Christine; Lawson, Nigel			Complementing institutional with localised strategies for climate change adaptation: a South-North comparison	DISASTERS			English	Article						adaptation; adaptive capacity; climate change; coping strategies; distributed governance; urban planning		Climate change and disasters pose a serious risk to sustainable development. In the South, local coping strategies are an important element of adaptation to climate and disaster risk. Such strategies have emerged because of the limited assistance provided by urban actors and associated social security and governance systems. In the North, in contrast, local coping strategies are comparatively poorly developed. However, the extent of the changing climatic conditions is also reducing the capacity of Northern institutions to deal with climatic extremes and variability, which emphasises the need for more local-level engagement in the North. This paper analyses the differences in local and institutional responses to climate change and disasters in a Southern and a Northern city (San Salvador, El Salvador, and Manchester, United Kingdom, respectively), and highlights how the lessons learned might be translated into an improved distributed governance system; that is, an integrated engagement model, where local and institutionalised responses support rather than hinder each other, as is currently the case.

On the one hand, the newly proposed refined five-component decomposition and its derived scattering powers are applied to detect the buildings. On the other hand, by combining the matrix elements and co-polarization correlation coefficient, a robust feature is proposed to discriminate buildings and non-buildings. Both these two preliminary extraction results are obtained through thresholding segmentation. Finally, they are fused via the HX Markov random fields so as to further improve the extraction accuracy. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated with Gaofen-3 and uninhabited aerial vehicle SAR full PolSAR data over different test sites. Outputs show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and provides an overall accuracy of over 90%.

J	Dong, SJ; Chen, ZC				Dong, Sijun; Chen, Zhengchao			A Multi-Level Feature Fusion Network for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation	SENSORS			English	Article						remote sensing image; image semantic segmentation; scale difference; feature fusion	SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION	High-resolution remote sensing image segmentation is a mature application in many industrial-level image applications and it also has military and civil applications. The scene analysis needs to be automated as much as possible with high-resolution remote sensing images. This plays a significant role in environmental disaster monitoring, forestry industry, agricultural farming, urban planning, and road analysis. This study proposes a multi-level feature fusion network (MFNet) that can integrate the multi-level features in the backbone to obtain different types of image information. Finally, the experiments in this study demonstrate that the proposed network can achieve good segmentation results in the Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets. By aiming to achieve a large difference in the scale of the target objects in remote sensing images and achieving a poor recognition result for small objects, a multi-level feature fusion solution is proposed in this study. This investigation improves the recognition results of the remote sensing image segmentation to a certain extent.

J	Xia, JS; Dong, PL				Xia, Jisheng; Dong, Pinliang			Spatial characteristics of physical environments for human settlements in Jinsha River watershed (Yunnan section), China	GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK			English	Article						Jinsha watershed; human settlements; GIS; analytic hierarchy process	SUITABILITY; COVERAGE; ISSUE	In recent years, natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, mudslides, collapses, drought, and extreme temperature occur frequently in Yunnan Jinsha River watershed, causing deterioration of physical environments for human settlements in some areas of the watershed. Although several studies have addressed individual environmental elements in the study area, efforts for integrated analysis of environmental factors and human settlements are still lacking. Therefore, it is important to identify the spatial distribution of physical environments for human settlements to support population distribution planning. This study includes 10 factors (topography, landform, vegetation, elevation, fault, rock, soil, earthquake intensity, temperature, and precipitation) as indicators for the assessment of human settlement suitability based on the analytic hierarchy process and grey correlation methods. Geographic information system functions were used to help understand the spatial distribution of human settlements and the causal factors. This study reveals different spatial units of the watershed suitable for human habitation from the viewpoint of physical environment and provides recommendations for urban planning and siting, land use planning, and disaster mitigation in the watershed.

LiDAR remote sensed data has been widely used in many applications, e.g. forest management, urban planning, disaster predictions, etc. However, extracting useful information from LiDAR data remains challenging, especially in the urban remote sensing, where many objects have the same elevation and are connected, such as road and parking lots, trees and buildings. In this work, we present a new method to extract geometric and textural information from LiDAR data by using attribute filters with partial reconstruction. The proposed method can separate the connected objects and better model the geometric and textural information than traditional connected filters (e.g. attribute filters). Experimental results on LiDAR data from the 2013 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared to the methods using original LiDAR data or attribute profiles computed by traditional attribute filters, with the proposed method, overall classification accuracies were improved by 35% and 12%, respectively.

First, stay locations of all phone users were detected using existing methods. Second, areas and days where Events occurred were detected by aggregation of mass stay locations into 1-km-square grid polygons. Finally, the proposed method could detect Events with an especially large number of visitors in the year by removing the influences of Events that occurred continuously throughout the year. In addition, we demonstrated reasonable reliability of the proposed Event detection method by comparing the results of Event detection with light intensities obtained from the night light images from the DMSP/OLS night light images. Our method can detect not only positive events such as festivals but also negative events such as natural disasters and road accidents. These results are expected to support policy development of urban planning, disaster prevention, and transportation management.

J	Polat, HI				Polat, Halil Ibrahim			An Approach to the Green Area Parameter in Urban Transformation	CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN			English	Article						Urban Transformation; Green Space; Social Facilities		In this study, the green area value is obtained from the feasibility reports which are made in 4, 6-hectare region that is declared as a risky area within the framework of the Law of Transformation of Areas Under Disaster Risk (No. 6306) and Implementation Regulation and the green area per capita (m2/person) is determined. In urban planning in which all of the land-use, social, technical infrastructure parameters need to be considered at the optimum level as a whole, according to this article; even if only the green area data is taken into consideration, the importance of making a transformation decision for the region is supported by the analysis. In this context; an analysis and calculation model has been proposed with the parameters defined in suggestion form which is bordered with the boundary value conditions in the light of international and national data. In the current situation, development plans' situation and the draft case, it is tried to compare the amounts of the green areas and to give an approach for the green area ratio per capita.

Reliable and consistent extraction of quantitative information from remotely sensed imagery is crucial to the success of any of the above applications. This paper describes the development of an automated roof detection system from single monocular electro-optic satellite imagery. The system employs a fresh approach in which each input image is segmented at several levels. The border line definition of such segments combined with line segments detected on the original image are used to generate a set of quadrilateral rooftop hypotheses. For each hypothesis a probability score is computed that represents the evidence of true building according to the image gradient field and line segment definitions. The presented results demonstrate that the system is capable of detecting small gabled residential rooftops with variant light reflection properties with high positional accuracies.

Designing, planning, and managing resilient cities: A conceptual framework	CITIES			English	Article						Resilience; Cities; Stressors; Decline; Disruption; Disaster; Urban planning; Urban networks; Technology	NEW-YORK-CITY	To what must cities be resilient? How can cities, as complex systems, be resilient? Building a capacity for resilience might be a daunting task when one considers the multitude of components, processes, and interactions that take place within and beyond a city's physical, logical (i.e. legal), and virtual (cyber-space) boundaries. Planning for resilience to the impacts of stressors within cities requires an evaluation of the vulnerable components of cities, an understanding of the key processes, procedures, and interactions that organize these components and develop the capacity to address various structuring of components and their interactions with the ultimate goal of achieving resilience. This paper provides a deeper look at resilience in cities, proposes a conceptual resilience framework, and includes a discussion and analysis of the framework. The proposed framework is meant to serve as a more holistic approach to designing, planning, and managing for resilience by including an evaluation of cultural and process dynamics within cities as well as their physical elements.

However, the complex appearance and various scales of buildings in remote-sensing images bring a challenge for building extraction. In this study, we developed a novel multiscale building extraction method based on refined attention pyramid networks (RAPNets). We built an encoder-decoder structure, and combine atrous convolution, deformable convolution, attention mechanism, and pyramid pooling module to improve the performance of feature extraction in the encoding path. Moreover, the salient multiscale features were extracted by embedding the convolutional block attention module into the lateral connections. Finally, the refined feature pyramid structure was adopted in the decoding path to fuse the multiscale features to obtain the final extraction results.

The approach accounts for the number, location, and characteristics of future assets considering sources of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in several time-dependent variables. The value of the methodology is demonstrated at the urban scale using an earthquake scenario for the Great Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. Hundreds of trajectories representing future urban growth were generated using geographically weighted regression and multiple-agent systems. These were converted into exposure models featuring the spatial correlation of urban expansion and the densification of the built environment. The forecasted earthquake losses indicate a mean increase in the absolute human and economic losses by 2030. However, the trajectory of relative risk is reducing, suggesting that the long-term enforcement of seismic regulations and urban planning are effectively lowering seismic risk in the case of Costa Rica.

The use of UAVs has become widespread in recent years thanks to the development of technology and making them more accessible. The ability of UAVs to produce high accuracy 3D data and orthophoto images at low cost has also enabled the development of UAV photogrammetry. UAV-based systems are used in many fields such as agriculture, forestry, urban planning, earth events and disaster management, especially for military purposes. In this study, a simulation environment was created for the "Parrot Mini Drone", a mini quadcopter that can withstand environmental conditions, has an adaptable, motion stability, and can shoot video at the same time, and a 3-dimensional model of an area where visual data is collected was obtained. With this study, developed using MATLAB & Simulink, a three-dimensional map of a specific area was created with the help of a quadcopter.

In general, homogeneous graphic styles are used for visualization. For instance, photorealism is suitable for detailed presentations, and non-photorealism or abstract stylization is used to facilitate guidance of a viewer's gaze to prioritized information. However, to adapt visualization to different contexts and contents and to support saliency-guided visualization based on user interaction or dynamically changing thematic information, a combination of different graphic styles is necessary. Design and implementation of such combined graphic styles pose a number of challenges, specifically from the perspective of real-time 3D visualization. In this paper, the authors present a concept and an implementation of a system that enables different presentation styles, their seamless integration within a single view, and parametrized transitions between them, which are defined according to tasks, camera view, and image resolution. The paper outlines potential usage scenarios and application fields together with a performance evaluation of the implementation.

Starting from data obtained from different sources they are capable to assemble them, to process them and to analyze them, to elaborate and to present geo-referenced information contributing in an essential mode to territory management. Accurate cartographic feature extraction, map updating, digital city models and 3D city models in urban areas are essential for many applications, such as mapping of buildings and their heights, simulation of new buildings, military operations, disaster management, updating and keeping cadastral databases current, and virtual reality. This paper highlights the development of GIS applicability in urban management. With all these information short, medium and long term strategies can be developed, regarding urban planning and management in the context of general sustainable development. Also, the importance of the paper lies in the GIS application role, as an efficient management tool for a vast amount of spatial urban relevant data thus contributing at the optimization of the activity carried on by the local administrations.

The economic costs of a landslide disaster include relocation of communities and physical repair of urban infrastructure. However, when performing a quantitative risk analysis, generally, the indirect economic consequences of such an event are not taken into account. A probabilistic approach methodology that considers several scenarios of hazard and vulnerability to measure the magnitude of the landslide and to quantify the economic costs is proposed. With this approach, it is possible to carry out a quantitative evaluation of the risk by landslides, allowing the calculation of the economic losses before a potential disaster in an objective, standardized and reproducible way, taking into account the uncertainty of the building costs in the study zone. The possibility of comparing different scenarios facilitates the urban planning process, the optimization of interventions to reduce risk to acceptable levels and an assessment of economic losses according to the magnitude of the damage. For the development and explanation of the proposed methodology, a simple case study is presented, located in north-eastern zone of the city of Medellin. This area has particular geomorphological characteristics, and it is also characterized by the presence of several buildings in bad structural conditions. The proposed methodology permits to obtain an estimative of the probable economic losses by earthquake-induced landslides, taking into account the uncertainty of the building costs in the study zone. The obtained estimative shows that the structural intervention of the buildings produces a reduction the order of 21 % in the total landslide risk.

Such a failure could trigger dam-break tsunami-type flooding, or "dyke-break-induced tsunami", a possibility which has so far been overlooked in the field of coastal disaster science and management. To analyse the potential consequences of one such flooding event caused by a dyke failure, a hydrodynamic model was constructed based on the authors' field surveys of a vulnerable coastal location in Jakarta, Indonesia. In a 2 m land subsidence scenario - which is expected to take place in the study area after only about 10-20 years - the model results show that the floodwaters rapidly rise to a height of nearly 3 m, resembling the flooding pattern of earthquake-induced tsunamis. The depth-velocity product criterion suggests that many of the narrow pedestrian paths behind the dyke could experience strong flows, which are far greater than the safe limits that would allow pedestrian evacuation. A couple of alternative scenarios were also considered to investigate how such flood impacts could be mitigated by creating a mangrove belt in front of the dyke as an additional safety measure. The dyke-break-induced tsunamis, which in many areas are far more likely than regular earthquake tsunamis, cannot be overlooked and thus should be considered in disaster management and urban planning along the coasts of many developing countries.

Design/methodology/approach - Digital elevation model (DEM) data and ALOS image were used to create maps of the parameters of this study area: elevation, slope, coastal proximity, river, and land use. An analytical hierarchy process was used to assign weights to each parameter and a spatial multi-criteria analysis was applied through cell-based modelling for vulnerability mapping. Findings - The vulnerability map shows that 17.679 km(2) of the area could be inundated by a tsunami. High vulnerability areas were mostly found in coastal areas with a sloping coast and a cape area. A low elevation and the presence of rivers or water channels are factors that increase the impact of tsunamis. Inundation areas were predicted to spread in areas identified as having either high vulnerability or slightly high vulnerability. Research limitations/implications - Because of the limited geospatial data, the authors encourage further studies using DEM data with a high spatial resolution. Practical implications - The results of this research can be used as basic information for disaster mitigation and urban planning in coastal areas. Originality/value - This research creates a new approach for assessing which areas could be inundated by tsunamis, based on the vulnerability map generated through remote sensing and spatial multi-criteria analysis. Moreover, the parameters used are very close to those of actual inundation maps.

The extraction of the accurate building footprints in densely populated urban areas from medium resolution satellite images is still a challenging task which requires the development of the new methods to solve such problem. In this paper, a novel Dilated-ResUnet deep learning architecture for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images has been proposed. The proposed model has been tested on three novel building datasets that are prepared for three densely populated cities of India (viz. Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru) using Sentinel-2 satellite images and Planet OSM. First FCC (false colour composite) dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green bands, second FCC dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green and Blue bands and third is TCC (true colour composite) dataset by merging red, green and blue bands. The proposed architecture is applied to both the FCC datasets and TCC dataset separately; it has been identified that the proposed model has obtained better building extraction results using FCC (NIR, Red, Green) dataset. The input satellite image enhancement and extensive experimentations to identify the optimal deep learning hyper-parameters using FCC spatial dataset have also been carried out to further improve the performance of the proposed model. The results of the experimentations reveal that the proposed model has out-performed the state of the art models available in literature by achieving the F1-score of 0.4718 and Mean IoU of 0.582 for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The outcome of the research work can be utilized for urban planning and management, generate more ground truths for Sentinel-2 satellite images which further can be useful for other societal applications.

The seismic reflection technique is the most common technique used to image faults at depth, but it is difficult to precisely locate the upper breakpoint of active buried faults. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) provides high-resolution imaging in ultrashallow exploration, but the penetration depth of traditional GPR is shallow. In this work, we conducted six GPR surveys with multifrequency (25 MHz, 50 MHz and 100 MHz) and high-power GPR antennas across the possible range of the Shuiyu fault based on seismic reflection results. We obtained the trace of the Shuiyu fault within 45 m of the surface in Datong city, and the fault was found to dip approximately 70-80 degrees to the SE. According to the GPR results, we selected a location for trenching and excavated one trench across the Shuiyu fault. The trench results verified the accuracy of the fault imaging in the GPR profiles and helped to interpret the stratigraphic information in the GPR profiles. In the accurate detection of active buried faults in other urban areas, the seismic reflection method can be used to determine the main strike of faults at depth, and then GPR can be used to detect the near-surface distribution of the faults in detail and guide trench location selection. The application of high-power GPR antennas with different frequencies in the fast detection of the upper breakpoint of active buried faults in urban areas is of great significance to earthquake hazard analysis and urban planning in Datong city.

Risk assessment is a complex issue that aims to assess different aspects of disaster damage. Traditionally, risk analysis is based on a series of historical and site data to verify the probability that an event occurs in a certain place with a certain intensity at a certain time (Orlando et al. 2005a, b). The main limitation of this method is the complexity of the mathematical models necessary to represent reality and therefore it is not always possible to make realistic assumptions about possible future scenarios. Furthermore, the interest is concentrated only on disaster scenarios deriving from a type of geological risk: either floods, or seismicity, etc. Therefore, a new approach is needed that takes into account all aspects of geological risk as a product of danger and vulnerability, and that will serve to define the response capacity of a territorial disaster system. A weighted combination of vulnerability and danger has finally allowed to determine the geological risk, whose planning applications urban planning and Civil Protection were examined in detail in the concluding chapters. The evaluation phase is carried out through the Analysis Hierarchy Process method. The aim of the research is to test procedures of analysis and techniques of geological risk assessment that take into account the complexity of the geological system and the state of the building heritage. In this work, completely independent of the vulnerability, we proceed to the definition of the danger as the sum of the geomorphological, hydraulic and seismic one. The result is a mapping of the areas studied (information base) elaborated in a GIS environment consisting of "layers of information layers of danger" interpolated with "layers of information layers on the structural history of the building", descriptive of the state of the building heritage. The approach is tested in a case study estimating all geological risks in the Municipality of Polignano a Mare (Puglia, Italy). This contribution showed that the proposed method would allow the development of a methodology that ensures replicability applicable to the various centers in Puglia.

The methodology developed a computational assessment tool based on the Multiple Correspondence Analysis and the framework for vulnerability analysis in sustainable science. This approach uses participatory mapping and on-site data. The data collection was easily implemented with free software tools to facilitate its use in low-income urban territories. The method combines the evaluation of experts using the of the traditional approach for the qualification of the variables of vulnerability in its three components (exposure, susceptibility, and resilience), and incorporates a computational method of the correspondence analysis family to formulate the indicators of vulnerability. The results showed that the multiple correspondence analysis is useful for the identification of the most representative variables in the vulnerability assessment, used for the construction of spatial disaggregated vulnerability indicators and therefore the development of vulnerability maps that will help in the short term in disaster risk management, urban planning, and infrastructure protection. In addition, the variables of the susceptibility component are the most representative regardless of the type of flooding, followed by the variables of the exposure component, for sudden flood-prone territories, and the resilience component for slow flood-prone territories. Our findings and the computational tool can facilitate the prioritization of improvement projects and flood risk management on a household, neighborhood, and municipal level.

J	Bostenaru Dan, M; Armas, I				Bostenaru Dan, M.; Armas, I.			Earthquake impact on settlements: the role of urban and structural morphology	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							WALKING; DERIVE	This study is aimed to create an alternative to the classical GIS representation of the impact of earthquake hazards on urban areas. To accomplish this, the traditional map was revised, so that it can cope with contemporary innovative ways of planning, namely strategic planning. As in the theory of fractals, the building dimension and the urban neighbourhood dimension are addressed as different geographic scales between which lessons for decisions can be learned through regression. The interaction between the two scales is useful when looking for alternatives, for the completion of a GIS analysis, and in choosing the landmarks, which, in the case of hazards, become strategic elements in strategic planning. A methodology to innovate mapping as a digital means for analysing and visualising the impact of hazards is proposed. This method relies on concepts from various geography, urban planning, structural engineering and architecture approaches related to disaster management. The method has been tested at the building scale for the N-S Boulevard in Bucharest, Romania, called Magheru. At the urban scale, an incident database has been created, in which the case study for the building level can be mapped. The paper presented is part of a larger research work, which addresses decision making using the framework shown here. The main value of the paper is in proposing a conceptual framework to deconstruct the map for digital earthquake disaster impact analysis and representation. The originality of the concept consists in the representation of elements at different scales considered to be of different levels of importance in the urban tissue, according to the analysis to be performed on them.

Evidence from the literature suggests that resident participation enhances assessment of environmental risks, raises awareness and empowers residents to fight for equitable distribution of hazard and climate risk adaptations. Yet, risk assessment and urban planning processes still frequently operate within expertise-driven groups without significant community engagement. Such fragmentation results in part from a lack of appreciation for community expertise in built environment adaptations and educational tools to support resident involvement in the often technical built environment planning processes. Design/methodology/approach - A participatory research and place-based education project was developed that enhanced co-learning between residents and researchers while collecting and analyzing local data on flood resilience in the built environment. Five research activities constitute the curriculum of resilience education on stormwater infrastructure: establishment of partnership agreement/memorandum of understanding, participatory GIS to identify flooding issues, water quality testing and health survey, stormwater infrastructure assessment and urban/landscape design. Partners included high school and college students, residents and environmental justice organizations. Findings - Outcomes include a stakeholder-approved infrastructure assessment smartphone application, neighborhood maps of drainage issues, a report of water containments and neighborhood-scaled green infrastructure provisions and growth plans. Findings indicate that participatory research positively contributed to resilience knowledge of participants. Originality/value - This paper outlines an interdisciplinary pedagogical strategy for resilience planning that engages residents to assess and monitor the performance of stormwater infrastructure and create resilience plans. The paper also discusses challenges and opportunities for similar participatory projects.

Even so, floods can be controlled by appropriate measures to minimize loss and damage. Flood risk assessment is an essential analytic step in preventing floods and reducing losses. Identifying previous flood risk and predicting future features are conducive to understanding the changing patterns and laws of flood risk. Taking the Dongjiang River basin as a study case, we assessed and regionalized flood risk in 1990, 2000, and 2010 from the past perspective and explored dynamic expansion during 1990-2010. Then, we projected land-use type, population, and gross domestic product in 2030 and 2050 and finally assessed and regionalized the risk from a future perspective. Results show that areas with very high risk accounted for 14.98-18.08% during 1990-2010; approximately 13.90% areas of the basin transformed from lower-level risk to higher-level risk whereas 9.07% fell from a higher level to a lower level during the period. For the future scenario, areas with very high and high risk in 2030 and 2050 are expected to account for 21.55% and 24.84%, respectively. Generally, our study can better identify changes in flood risk at a spatial scale and reveal the dynamic evolution rule, which provides a synthetical means of flood prevention and reduction, flood insurance, urban planning, and water resource management in the future under global climate change, especially for developing or high-speed urbanization regions.

As the largest NW-trend active fault in Beijing area, the Nankou-Sunhe fault plays an important role in earthquake disaster and city construction. In this study, we collect continuous ambient noise data recorded by 43 temporary short-period seismograph between September 21th to October 12th 2019 to investigate the near-surface structure beneath the Nankou-Sunhe fault by using ambient noise tomography (ANT) and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) method. From ambient noise processing, fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave signals are clearly observed in the frequency band of 0.4-2.5 Hz. Then direct surface-wave inversion algorithm is applied to calculate the 3D shear-wave velocity model. Our results show that there is a sharp velocity contrast across the Nankou-Sunhe fault, with low velocities down to about 2 km on the hanging wall and high velocity on the footwall of the fault. According to the geological investigation, the low velocities are related to thicker sediments and Jurassic volcanic rock below which are the cap rock of the hydrothermal system. From the HVSR analysis, the HVSR curves of the sites near the fault shows double-peak, one less than 1 Hz and the other centered 7 Hz. After converting frequency to depth by the empirical equation, the results show that the thickness of sediments is thinned from southwest to northeast, which generally agrees well to field survey. Our results provide high-resolution near-surface structure for future study on disaster risk reduction and urban planning.

Therefore, research on urban flood risks has greatly increased over the past decade, with studies focusing on reducing the risk of flood disaster. From 2012 to 2020, the impervious underlying surface has increased, and the permeable underlying surface has decreased annually in Kunming City. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of continuous changes in the urban underlying surface on flood disasters in the Runcheng area south of Kunming City from 2012 to 2020. We constructed a two-dimensional flood model to conduct flood simulations and flood risk analysis for this area. The relationship between the permeability of the underlying surface and urban flood risk was simulated and analyzed by varying the urban underlying surface permeability (0-60%). The simulation results show that the model can accurately simulate urban waterlogging, and the increase in urban waterlogging risk is related to the underlying surface permeability. Urban flood risk decreases with the increase in permeable underlying surface. The increase rate of flood risk in the part with permeability of 0-35% is greater than that the part with permeability of 35-60%, that is, when the permeability of underlying surface is lower than 35%, the flood risk rate will be higher.

J	Yagoub, MM; Al Yammahi, AA				Yagoub, M.

Heritage sites in any country have important cultural and economic value. However, many of the sites are subjected to potential impact by natural hazards, considering their age and the effects of climate. In the interest of reducing these impacts, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and the World Heritage Committee called for a detailed hazard assessment. This research falls within this assessment scope by applying remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to assess the spatial distribution of natural hazards and their proximity to heritage sites in the UAE. Results show that heritage sites in the northeastern UAE are more vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, and sea-level rise. Still, risk varies depending on elevation and the proximity to fault lines and the coastline. In the western UAE, the majority of heritage sites are prone to the effects of desertification and sand encroachment. This study is large-scale in nature, and specific vulnerability assessments for each heritage site are beyond the scope of this paper. The database, methodology, and output from this research could be useful for many organizations, such as those working in the fields of culture and heritage, tourism, disaster management, and urban planning. Compilation of a GIS database centering upon the heritage sites in the UAE is considered a major step forward for future studies related to the sites. The GIS database is available for interested users upon request.	[Yagoub, M.

Analysis of the interrelationship between houses, trees and damage in a cyclone affected city: Can landscape design and planning utilising trees minimise cyclone impact?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Arboreal services; Risk mitigation; Disaster management; Landscape ecology; Climate change; Green infrastructure	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; URBAN FOREST DEBRIS; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; STREET TREES; WIND; AUSTRALIA; DISASTERS; PATTERNS; FORCES; CITIES	Under scenarios of climate change the likelihood of more intensive extreme weather events like tropical cyclones is expected to increase and many tropical regions most at risk from cyclones are still developing economically. With increased urbanisation predicted over the next 20-50 years to cope with population growth, it is important that planning for urban development in these regions considers amelioration of danger, especially the impacts associated with cyclone damage. Approaches to risk management can learn a lot from past experiences with cyclonic events. The knowledge that was accumulated after the devastation of Darwin, Australia by Cyclone Tracy in 1974 provides important evidence that can contribute towards risk mitigation and disaster management in the future. Applying a mixed methods approach, this study examines historical information collected at the time of Cyclone Tracy to help understand the role of the urban forest and positioning of housing in reducing cyclone damage. It includes a review of whether the pattern of tree cover, which is influenced by geophysical and socio-cultural factors, mitigates or exacerbates cyclone damage. The results of the study show that although the relationship is complex, trees appear to have a role to play in ameliorating cyclone damage under certain conditions. This potential gain, along with the other benefits trees offer to tropical urban areas, means that trees are an important consideration for future urban planning in developing regions.

An Adaptive Active Contour Model for Building Extraction from Aerial Images	2017 PALESTINIAN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (PICICT)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Palestinian International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (PICICT)	MAY 08-09, 2017	Gaza, PALESTINE	European Inst Training & Dev		Building extraction; ACM Model; Snake Model; GVF Model	SNAKES	Building extraction from aerial images is one of the recent topics of remote sensing used in many applications such as urban planning, disaster management, military planning, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). One of the commonly used approaches in building extraction is Active Contour Model (ACM), also called snake model, for its ability to extract contours of structured and unstructured shapes of objects. However, using traditional ACM model in building extraction faces the problem of narrowly concave contour regions. In this research, we propose to solve the deep concavities problem with the use of a concavity index which adaptively determines the rigidity coefficient of the snake points located in the deeply narrow segments of the contour. Our adaptive model was tested on different sets of buildings extracted from aerial images. Results were evaluated using two evaluation approaches. One in terms of accuracy, precision and recall, and the other in terms of the Error Distance Ratio (ERd) which is the average ratio of distance between each snake point and the true edge map point (by pixels). Result were compared with the GVF snake model in terms of both accuracy and execution time.

J	Lambert, R				Lambert, Rita			The violence of planning law and the production of risk in Lima	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Urban planning; Informal urbanisation; Violence; Abstraction; Risk; Lima	DISASTER RISK; LATIN-AMERICA; INFORMALITY; SPACE; URBANIZATION; ABSTRACTION; CITIES; POOR	Counteracting law violation and the haphazard occupation of marginal land as an explanation for how risk becomes inherent to informal urbanisation, I demonstrate in this paper that hazardous conditions are an outcome of practices that seek to comply with planning law. Risk on the steep slopes of Lima is reproduced by unchanged and inflexible planning regulations and instruments, and not by their absence. Building on scholarship at the nexus of planning and informality, and borrowing from socio-spatial and legal geography, I argue that planning law and legal texts regulate the spatial layouts of human settlements in ways that produce concrete abstraction and exacerbate unintended outcomes. Using extensive case study research and ethnographic methods, I unpack three perverse spatial configurations on the peripheral slopes of Lima: the grid layout resulting in excessively steep access ways, electricity poles in the middle of staircases and dangerous evacuation routes. I demonstrate how manoeuvres of fragmentation, homogenisation, and hierarchical ordering, active in planning processes and legal texts, lead to material and corporeal violence that maintain dwellers in perpetual landscapes of risk.

From academic to applied: Operationalising resilience in river systems	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	48th Annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium	OCT 13-15, 2017	Texas State Univ, San Marcos, TX		Texas State Univ	Complexity; Scientific method; Interdisciplinarity; Public policy; River management; River policy	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; ECOSYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; POLICY; SCIENCE; STATE	The concept of resilience acknowledges the ability of societies to live and develop with dynamic environments. Given the recognition of the need to prepare for anticipated and unanticipated shocks, applications of resilience are increasing as the guiding principle of public policy and programs in areas such as disaster management, urban planning, natural resource management, and climate change adaptation. River science is an area in which the adoption of resilience is increasing, leading to the proposition that resilience may become a guiding principle of river policy and programs. Debate about the role of resilience in rivers is part of the scientific method, but disciplinary disunity about the ways to approach resilience application in policy and programs may leave river science out of the policy process. We propose six elements that need to be considered in the design and implementation of resilience-based river policy and programs: rivers as social-ecological systems; the science-policy interface; principles, capacities, and characteristics of resilience: cogeneration of knowledge: adaptive management: and the state of the science of resilience.

Toward Multilabel Image Retrieval for Remote Sensing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Measurement; Image retrieval; Training; Databases; Semantics; Protocols; Remote sensing; Image retrieval; loss function; multilabel; query expansion; remote sensing (RS)	NETWORK	The availability of large-scale remote sensing (RS) data facilitates a wide range of applications, such as disaster management and urban planning. An approach for such problems is image retrieval, where, given a query image, the goal is to find the most relevant match from a database. Most RS literature has been focused on single-label retrieval, where we assume an image has a single label. The primary challenge in single-label RS retrieval is that performance in most datasets is saturated, and it has become difficult to compare the performance of different methods. In this work, we extend the major multilabel classification datasets to the multilabel retrieval problem. We also define protocols, provide evaluation metrics, and study the impact of commonly used loss functions and reranking methods for multilabel retrieval. To this end, a novel multilabel loss function and a reranking technique are proposed, which circumvent the challenges present in conventional single-label image retrieval. The developed loss function considers both class and feature similarity. The proposed reranking technique achieves high performance with computation cost that is well-suited for fast online retrieval.

This city has grown rapidly because of disaster recovery activities. Therefore, this study aims to identify the types of urban physical growth in Banda Aceh City quantitatively from 2005 to 2019. The characteristics of growth were identified by integrating geographic information systems and remote sensing. The analysis showed that the main types of urban physical growth in the city were edge-expansion in 2005-2009 and infilling in 2009-2019. The percentage of spontaneous growth area was the lowest in both periods. The process of reconstruction and rehabilitation was considered to greatly affect the types of urban physical growth, where newly built-up areas were established close to the existing built-up areas. This also caused urban densification in a relatively short time. The process of urbanization had reached a stable stage in the city so that the surrounding suburbs have the potential to experience regional transformation. Overall, the approach used in this study resulted in a more objective understanding of identifying the urban physical growth characteristics for better urban planning.

Although understanding such ever-changing events over all these cities is important for urban planning, traffic management, and disaster response, this is quite a huge challenge. This paper proposes a method of visualizing spatio-temporal events with a multi-layered geo-locational word-cloud representation from a geo-parsed microblog stream. Real-time geo-parsing first geo-locates posts in the stream, using geo-tags and mentioned places and facilities as clues. Temporal local events are then identified and represented by a set of words specifically observed in a certain location and time grid, and then displayed above a map as word-clouds. We detect the locality of events to split them into multiple layers to avoid occlusions between local (e.g., music concerts) and global (e.g., earthquakes and marathon races) events. Users can thereby distinguish local from global events, and see their interactions over the layered maps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to real events extracted from our archive accumulated from five years of Twitter posts.

J	Richter, R; Behrens, M; Dollner, J				Richter, Rico; Behrens, Markus; Doellner, Juergen			Object class segmentation of massive 3D point clouds of urban areas using point cloud topology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							AIRBORNE LIDAR DATA; ALGORITHMS	A large number of remote-sensing techniques and image-based photogrammetric approaches allow an efficient generation of massive 3D point clouds of our physical environment. The efficient processing, analysis, exploration, and visualization of massive 3D point clouds constitute challenging tasks for applications, systems, and workflows in disciplines such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and homeland security. We present an approach to segment massive 3D point clouds according to object classes of virtual urban environments including terrain, building, vegetation, water, and infrastructure. The classification relies on analysing the point cloud topology; it does not require per-point attributes or representative training data. The approach is based on an iterative multi-pass processing scheme, where each pass focuses on different topological features and considers already detected object classes from previous passes. To cope with the massive amount of data, out-of-core spatial data structures and graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated algorithms are utilized. Classification results are discussed based on a massive 3D point cloud with almost 5 billion points of a city. The results indicate that object-class-enriched 3D point clouds can substantially improve analysis algorithms and applications as well as enhance visualization techniques.

The fast and efficient detection of urban changes enables us to update geo-databases and allows effective planning and disaster management. This study concerns the visualization and analysis of urban changes using multi-period point clouds from aerial images. The urban changes in the city centre of the Konya Metropolitan area within arbitrary periods between the years 1951, 1975, 1998 and 2010 were estimated after comparing the point clouds by using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The changes were detected with the point-to-surface distances between the point clouds. The degrees of the changes were expressed with the RMSEs of these point-to-surface distances. In addition, the change size and proportion during the historical periods were analysed. The proposed multi-period change visualization and analysis method ensures strict management against unauthorized building or excavation and more operative urban planning.

J	Gadhiya, T; Roy, AK				Gadhiya, Tushar; Roy, Anil K.			Optimized Wishart Network for an Efficient Classification of Multifrequency PolSAR Data	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						k-means algorithm; multifrequency polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification; neural network; optimized Wishart network (OWN); PolSAR; Wishart distance; WN	POLARIMETRIC SAR; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION	High-resolution wide-area images are required in the diverse field of research ranging from urban planning and disaster prediction to agriculture and geology. Sometimes the image is taken under harsh weather conditions or at night time. Current optical remote sensing technology does not have the capability to acquire images in such conditions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) uses microwave signal which has a long-range propagation characteristic that allows us to capture images in difficult weather conditions. In addition to this, some polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) systems are also capable of capturing images using multifrequency bands simultaneously resulting into a multitude of information in comparison to the optical images. In this letter, we propose a single-hidden layer optimized Wishart network (OWN) and extended OWN for classification of the single-frequency and multifrequancy PolSAR data, respectively. Performance evaluation is conducted on a single-frequency as well as multifrequency SAR data obtained by Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar. We observed that for combining multiple hand information, proposed single-hidden layer network outperforms deep learning-based architecture involving multiple hidden layers.

OBJECTS GROUPING FOR SEGMENTATION OF ROADS NETWORK IN HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGES OF URBAN AREAS	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing		Road extraction; Segmentation; Objects grouping; Object based image analysis; Maximal similarity region merging	EXTRACTION	Updated road databases are required for many purposes such as urban planning, disaster management, car navigation, route planning, traffic management and emergency handling. In the last decade, the improvement in spatial resolution of VHR civilian satellite sensors - as the main source of large scale mapping applications - was so considerable that GSD has become finer than size of common urban objects of interest such as building, trees and road parts. This technological advancement pushed the development of "Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA)" as an alternative to pixel-based image analysis methods. Segmentation as one of the main stages of OBIA provides the image objects on which most of the following processes will be applied. Therefore, the success of an OBIA approach is strongly affected by the segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose a purpose-dependent refmement strategy in order to group road segments in urban areas using maximal similarity based region merging. For investigations with the proposed method, we use high resolution images of some urban sites. The promising results suggest that the proposed approach is applicable in grouping of road segments in urban areas.

J	Breunig, M; Zlatanova, S				Breunig, Martin; Zlatanova, Sisi			3D geo-database research: Retrospective and future directions	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Review						Geo-database; Geo-data modelling; 3D GIS; Information systems for geo- and environmental sciences	MODEL; 3-D; GIS; DBMS	3D geo-database research is a promising field to support challenging applications such as 3D urban planning, environmental monitoring, infrastructure management, and early warning or disaster management and response. In these fields, interdisciplinary research in GIScience and related fields is needed to support the modelling, analysis, management, and integration of large geo-referenced data sets, which describe human activities and geophysical phenomena. Geo-databases may serve as platforms to integrate 2D maps, 3D geo-scientific models, and other geo-referenced data. However, current geo-databases do not provide sufficient 3D data modelling and data handling techniques. New 3D geo-databases are needed to handle surface and volume models. This article first presents a 25-year retrospective of geo-database research. Data modelling, standards, and indexing of geo-data are discussed in detail. New directions for the development of 3D geo-databases to open new fields for interdisciplinary research are addressed. Two scenarios in the fields of early warning and emergency response demonstrate the combined management of human and geophysical phenomena. The article concludes with a critical outlook on open research problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Many of existing studies have focused on managing and analyzing only time-varying locations of point-based objects. However, real-world moving phenomena are space-time continua occupying volumes, having an area at a time; even more, they contain dynamic attributes depending on time and space, such as the velocity of vehicles or the average of wind speed of hurricanes. In this demonstration, we introduce a comprehensive data format to represent various types of temporal geometries and dynamic properties of moving objects based on OGC (R) Moving Features. Moreover, we present a visual extension of Cesium to visualize moving objects in a space-time cube by cooperating with a data server that manages moving objects in a Cassandra database via RESTful APIs. This demonstration presents how to analyze a correlation between typhoon trajectories and geo-tagged Twitter messages with our systems.

This paper presents a novel method for residential building reconstruction and modeling in urban areas using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and satellite imagery. The main contribution is the automatic isolation of building roofs and roof reconstruction based on the fusion of LiDAR data and satellite imagery. By using cue lines which are generated from satellite imagery to separate buildings from other objects (including other buildings), we are able to automatically identify individual buildings from residential clutter and re-create a virtual representation with improved accuracy and reasonable computation time. We applied the method to urban sites in the city of New Orleans and demonstrated that it identified building measurements successfully and rendered 3D models effectively. Our experiments show that our method can successfully reconstruct small buildings with relatively sparse LiDAR sampling and in the presence of noise.

It is imperative to reduce the risk of urban rainstorm flood disasters, which is growing along with urbanization, during the process of urban planning and construction. However, because of the complexity of urban elements, it is quite difficult to identify sensitive indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters to provide effective guidance on flood control. In this study, the composition of urban elements was systematically proposed based on Descriptive Framework for Cities and Communities, including natural, structural, and social elements, and then a specific indicator system was established. Furthermore, Random Forest Model was used to determine the relative importance of the indicators that are closely related to the direct economic loss that reflects the severity of urban rainstorm flood disasters. Considering four cities in China, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Shanghai, with different topographical and hydrological conditions, as examples, the sensitivity indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters were identified, and the results were verified based on the catastrophe evaluation method. The results indicate that urban rainstorm flood disasters are the most sensitive to surface water resources, and are the least sensitive to relief degree of land surface. Finally, specific measures to mitigate urban rainstorm flood disasters were proposed.

Nigeria and a few other Asian nations will account for 35% of the urban increase in the future, and there is a scientific projection that further megacities will emerge. Besides, sustainable cities and societies are those that strive to leave a net-zero carbon footprint through smart urban planning and city management. So, in developing public transport scheme, it is essential to manage and implement sustainability assessment performance. In Nigeria, there is a sustainability literacy gap, due to a lack of measurable sustainability techniques, and this has resulted in social, economic and environmental dissatisfaction towards completed highways and roads in the cities. The roads and highways are considered an essential part of modern daily life and will play a key role in the development of sustainable cities. To bridge the knowledge gap, this study argues to develop a sustainability assessment rating system in evaluating highway and road designs in Nigeria. Thirtysix (36) sustainability indicators relevant in assessing highway design are identified along with the sustainability application framework. The findings contribute to gaining insight into climate change impact, and the benefits it makes in adopting an assessment rating system in highway development to decrease climate change catastrophe.

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE APPLICATION AREAS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN THE AEC DOMAIN	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; UAV; AEC Industry; Technology; Application; Systematic Review; UAS	INSPECTION; IMAGERY; SFM; UAS	The recent increase in the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civilian usage stems mainly from modern technological advancements and the devices ' abilities to accomplish civilian tasks in a quick, safe, and cost-efficient manner. One sector that witnessed tremendous UAV impact is the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Among several AEC applications, UAV technology is currently being implemented for building and bridge inspection, progress monitoring, and urban planning. The following review aims at thoroughly classifying all AEC-related UAV applications within the past decade, extending the understanding of the current state of UAV implementation in the AEC domain, and outlining relevant research trends in this setting. The review follows a systematic literature assessment methodology in which peer-reviewed bibliographical databases were queried, based on specific search keywords, for AEC-related UAV applications. This study also discusses the technological components (flying styles, types of platforms, onboard sensors) to assist in better developing, integrating, and understanding the technology implemented in the AEC industry. Our search query yielded 228 articles, of which 86 met our inclusion criteria and were therefore analyzed. Seven categories of structural and infrastructure inspection, transportation, cultural heritage conservation, city and urban planning, progress monitoring, post-disaster, and construction safety were identified and fully analyzed in this study. The study revealed that UAV integration in the AEC domain might exhibit equal, if not, higher outcomes compared to conventional methods as to time, accuracy, safety, and costs. In terms of technology, the control styles reported were mostly autonomous and manual. Rotary wing vehicles were the predominant type of platforms in the literature. Of the rotary wing type, quadcopters were most commonly employed. Readily available, or "off-the-shelf" video recording cameras and thermal cameras were most frequently mounted on UAVs, followed by LiDAR and laser scanning devices. Other sensors included Radio Frequency Identification and Ultrasonic Beacon System. The outcome of this study would benefit both AEC researchers and professionals to recognize the potentials of UAVs and understand the requirements and challenges for their successful integration.

The effectiveness of this process is highly dependent on the quality of the input data of both hazard and vulnerability maps and the method utilized. On the one hand, for higher-quality hazard maps, the use of 2D models is generally suggested. However, in ungauged regions, such usage becomes a difficult task, especially at the microscale. On the other hand, vulnerability mapping at the microscale suffers limitations as a result of the failure to consider vulnerability components, the low spatial resolution of the input data, and the omission of urban planning aspects that have crucial impacts on the resulting quality. This paper aims to enhance the quality of both hazard and vulnerability maps at the urban microscale in ungauged regions. The proposed methodology integrates remote sensing data and high-quality city strategic plans (CSPs) using geographic information systems (GISs), a 2D rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) simulation model, and multicriteria decision-making analysis (MCDA, i.e., the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)). This method was implemented in Hurghada, Egypt, which from 1996 to 2019 was prone to several urban flood events. Current and future physical, social, and economic vulnerability maps were produced based on seven indicators (land use, building height, building conditions, building materials, total population, population density, and land value). The total vulnerability maps were combined with the hazard maps based on the Kron equation for three different return periods (REPs) 50, 10, and 5 years to create the corresponding flood risk maps. In general, this integrated methodology proved to be an economical tool to overcome the scarcity of data, to fill the gap between urban planning and flood risk management (FRM), and to produce comprehensive and high-quality flood risk maps that aid decision-making systems.

Municipalities have important capacities as executors of local development plans. The purpose of this study was to identify and rank factors affecting urban health promotion in five metropolises of Iran. Materials and Methods : Statistical sample was selected based on Cochran formula by stratified random sampling in Tehran, Tabriz, Isfahan, Shiraz, Mashhad metropolises. The purpose of this study was applied and descriptive in nature. Validity of the questionnaire was based on Delphi technique and content validity with relative coefficient above 4 and reliability with Cronbach's alpha coefficient with 0.84. Confirmed. After collecting the questionnaires, descriptive and inferential statistics (spss and emus software) were used. One-way ANOVA and Duncan tests were used to compare the dimensions of health promotion. Results: Effective dimensions of urban health promotion can be categorized into six dimensions which then improve urban living conditions with a coefficient of 0.96. The highest score and the founding dimension of Elderly Friendly Cities with a coefficient of 0.83. It was the least important. Conclusion : Comparison of the dimensions of health promotion in the five metropolitan areas revealed no significant differences between the four dimensions (improvement of urban living conditions, establishment of Elderly Friendly Cities, resilience of crisis and disaster areas, and general health promotion) in different metropolises. But there is a significant difference between the two aspects of promoting urban planning to promote healthy and safe behaviors and ensuring participatory governance in the city. Based on Duncan's test, metropolises can be divided into two groups; the cities of Tehran and Mashhad are grouped in one group and the cities of Shiraz, Tabriz and Isfahan in the dimension of urban planning to promote healthy and safe behaviors. In terms of ensuring participatory governance in the city, Tehran, Shiraz and Mashhad, the second group was classified as Isfahan and Tabriz.

Public and private operators seek to address-and solve- the key topic of the impossibility, via ordinary tools, of developing significant parts of the city, relying on the minimum requirement in terms of standards and public areas to be sold to citizen community, given the limited economic resources available for the public Administrations. Through instruments such as Masterplan, they offer the opportunity to design new urban territories with the introduction of high-quality solutions in terms of connections between empty spaces and constructions, life quality and environmental sustainability. (Giberti, 2008). The growing complexity of the urban landscape of the Italian cities, more and more influenced by exogenous reasons (events, natural disasters, financial programs..), confirmed the dual role that the Urban Planning Project can acquire, taking into account the Project typical local resources and at the same time providing the Plan guarantees of transformation, offering a more efficient and effective response than ordinary actions. The alternatives ran in the case of the city of L'Aquila, include on one hand the application of the slogan "where it was, as it was", through the accurate reconstruction of individual building, not considering the urban problems already present, and on the other hand, the Urban Regeneration Plans introduction, without any temporal certainty. The LAURAq and Laboratory AnTeAtoday experimentations are actually concentrated on the Urban Planning Project and resilience theme, particularly on the role of the network of public spaces in natural disasters. The "street" has a key role, since it is the main element of the public space in L'Aquila city, that even before the 2009 earthquake had evidents urban problems and that, post-disaster, was reorganized along a single main road, the National Road n. 17 (SS17), which moved from crossing roadtook to both distribution road and urban street.(http://www.laboratoriourbanisticoaquila.eu/index.html).(C) 2016 The Authors.

This paper presents a new pipeline for 3D reconstruction of buildings from RGB imagery captured via a drone. We leverage the commercial software Pix4D to construct a 3D point cloud from RGB drone imagery, which is then used in conjunction with image processing and geometric methods to extract a building footprint. The footprint is then extruded vertically based on the heights of the segmented rooftops. The footprint extraction involves two main steps, line segment detection and polygonization of the lines. To detect line segments, we project the point cloud onto a regular grid, detect preliminary lines using the Hough transform, refine them via RANSAC, and convert them into line segments by checking the density of the points surrounding the line. In the polygonization step, we convert detected line segments into polygons by constructing and completing partial polygons, and then filter them by checking for support in the point cloud. The polygons are then merged based on their respective height profiles. We have tested our system on two buildings of several thousand square feet in Alameda, CA, and obtained an F1 score of 0.93 and 0.95 respectively as compared to the ground truth.

J	Varriale, R				Varriale, Roberta			Re-Inventing Underground Space in Matera	HERITAGE			English	Article						underground settlement; cultural heritage; urban functions; gentrification; best-practice; reuse; enhancement; valorization; sustainable		The site of Sassi in Matera originates from a troglodyte village that is believed to be one of the first human settlements in Italy. The structure reflects the progressive transformation of natural caves into closed caves for urban use, and over time has distinguished a complex urban landscape that can only be fully appreciated when observed in cross-section. During the 20th century, the demographic rise and the socio-economic decline of the area turned these dwellings into a socio-environmental disaster and the area was definitively evacuated in the 1960s. Since then, the underground settlement has been revisited and is now considered and valorized as a cultural site. Inscribed in the UNESCO list in 1993, Sassi in Matera is the current European Capital of Culture (2019). This paper presents a brief overview on the worldwide approach to historical underground artifacts within contemporary urban planning, followed by an analysis of the application of the recent classification for underground built heritage (UBH) to Sassi. The different levels of reuse that have been carried out in Matera during the last decades are examined with a particular focus on the difficulties in facing gentrification, and examples of possible remedies provided by "ethical conservation for architecture" that preserves the communication of historical functions are discussed.

J	Gonzalez-Mathiesen, C; Ruane, S; March, A				Gonzalez-Mathiesen, Constanza; Ruane, Simone; March, Alan			Integrating wildfire risk management and spatial planning - A historical review of two Australian planning systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Review						Integration; Wildfire; Spatial planning; Urban planning; Disaster risk management; Governance	CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY; BUSHFIRE	Recent wildfires burning throughout Australia highlight the vulnerability of settlements located in wildland urban interface (WUI) areas. Spatial planning has a critical role in operationalising wildfire risk reduction considerations in a territorial manner across the WUI. Accordingly, more integrated approaches to wildfire management and spatial planning are necessary. However, there is limited literature examining the historical interactions between wildfire and spatial planning policy sectors and how institutions and policy instruments adapt over time to integrate mutually dependent considerations. To address this gap, this research examines how Australian spatial planning institutions and instruments evolved since European settlement to incorporate wildfire considerations, through a qualitative comparative case study approach of two Australian states. Based on the findings of the case study comparison, this paper presents a conceptual framework of the pathways towards increased policy integration of spatial planning and wildfire risk reduction that consists of six phases. It is argued that the path to greater policy integration is grounded on the development of common knowledge, a cross-disciplinary understanding, and agreed policy goals between different policy sectors, that, with time, translate into new institutional arrangements and instruments that integrate the work and decision-making processes of different sectors.

J	Khan, SD; Alarabi, L; Basalamah, S				Khan, Sultan Daud; Alarabi, Louai; Basalamah, Saleh			An Encoder-Decoder Deep Learning Framework for Building Footprints Extraction from Aerial Imagery	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						Building footprint extraction; Segmentation; Remote sensing		Building footprints segmentation in high-resolution satellite images has wide range of applications in disaster management, land cover analysis and urban planning. However, automatic extraction of building footprints offers many challenges due to large variations in building sizes, complex structures and cluttered background. Due to these challenges, current state-of-the-art methods are not efficient enough to completely extract buildings footprints and boundaries of different buildings. To this end, we propose an encoder-decoder framework that automatically extracts building footprints from satellite images. Specifically, the encoder part of the network uses a dense network that consists of dense convolutional and transition blocks to capture global multi-scale features. On the other hand, the decoder part of network uses sequence of deconvolution layers to recover the lost spatial information and obtains a dense segmentation map, where the white pixels represent buildings and black pixels represent background/other objects. In addition, we train the network in end-to-end fashion by using hybrid loss that enhances the performance of the framework. We use two publicly available benchmark datasets to gauge the performance of framework. From the experiments, we demonstrate that proposed method achieves comparatively best performance on challenging datasets.

J	Vale, LJ				Vale, Lawrence J.			The politics of resilient cities: whose resilience and whose city?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						disaster recovery; equity; resilience; resilient cities; social justice; urban planning and design; urban politics		It is vital to acknowledge the socio-political complexity of the deployment of the term resilience' and to develop a more unified set of expectations for the professions and disciplines that use it. Applied to cities, resilience is particularly problematic, yet also retains promise. Like resilience, the term city' is also subject to multiple contending definitions, depending on the scale and on whether the focus is on physical spaces or social communities. Due to cities and city-regions being organized in ways that both produce and reflect underlying socio-economic disparities, some parts are much more resilient than others and therefore vulnerability is often linked to both topography and income. Uneven resilience threatens the ability of cities as a whole to function economically, socially and politically. Resilience can only remain useful as a concept and as progressive practice if it is explicitly associated with the need to improve the life prospects of disadvantaged groups. This dimension is often lost in definitions of resilience drawn from engineering and ecology, but remains central to conceptualizations linked to social psychology. To improve the prospects of cities proactively (and reactively), there is a need to unify the insights from the multiple professions and disciplines that use resilience'.

Nevertheless, the processing of this kind of image is time-consuming, and extracting the needed information from among the huge quantity of data is a real challenge. For some applications such as natural disaster prevention and monitoring (typhoon, flood, bushfire, etc.), the use of fast and effective processing methods is demanded. Furthermore, such methods should be selective in order to extract only the information required to allow an efficient interpretation. For this purpose, we propose a texture region segmentation method using the level set algorithm and the multi-kernel theory. We design a selective and local multi-kernel stop function for which the regularization term depends on the fuzzy membership degree of a given pixel to be on the boundary or not. Favored by its local nature, the method is accelerated by means of an NVIDIA graphics processing unit programming. The new algorithm is selective, effective, and fast.

Since its inception in 2004, OpenStreetMap (OSM) sets the benchmark for open geospatial data and has become a key player in the public, research, and corporate realms. Following the foundations laid by OSM, several open geospatial products describing the built environment have blossomed including the Microsoft USA building footprint layer and the OpenAddress project. Each of these products use different data collection methods ranging from public contributions to artificial intelligence, and if taken together, could provide a comprehensive description of the built environment. Yet, these projects are still siloed, and their variety makes integration and interoperability a major challenge. Here, we document an approach for merging data from these three major open building datasets and outline a workflow that is scalable to the continental United States (CONUS). We show how the results can be structured as a knowledge graph over which machine learning models are built. These models can help propagate and complete unknown quantities that can then be leveraged in disaster management.	[Johnson, J.

As a carrier of human productive activities, buildings are essential to both urban dynamic monitoring and suburban construction inspection. Fully-convolutional-network-based methods have provided a paradigm for automatically extracting buildings from high-resolution imagery. However, high intraclass variance and complexity are two problems in building extraction. It is hard to identify different scales of buildings by using a single receptive field. For this purpose, in this article, we use the stable encoder- decoder architecture, combined with a grid-based attention gate and atrous spatial pyramid pooling module, to capture and restore features progressively and effectively. A modified ResNet50 encoder is also applied to extract features. The proposed method could learn gated features and distinguish buildings from complex surroundings such as trees. We evaluate our model on two building datasets, WHU aerial building dataset and our DB UAV rural building dataset. Experiments show that our model outperforms other five most recent models. The results also exhibit great potential for extracting buildings with different scales and validate the effectiveness of deep learning in practical scenarios.

J	Matsumiya, K; Oikawa, K				Matsumiya, Kaoru; Oikawa, Kiyoaki			Quantitative Analysis of Fire Spreading Potential for Surrounding Areas of Cultural Properties in Kyoto City	JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING			English	Article						cultural property buildings; fire spreading; covering volume fraction; dilation; cluster		Many cultural heritage sites exist in the historic city of Kyoto. Wooden buildings account for a majority of these sites, and they exist in a large proportion in the surrounding urban areas. Therefore, protecting Kyoto's cultural properties from fire hazards is a pressing issue in urban planning. Based on this type of problem awareness, this study aims to produce basic documentation related to future disaster-prevention measures for cultural properties. First, we conducted a field survey of the buildings surrounding cultural properties and compiled critical distance of fire spreading dilated volume fraction (DVF) buffer data for each structure. We calculated the critical distance of fire spreading taking into account the weather conditions of wind speed and direction, and illustrated the DVF buffer using image processing techniques and created a fire spreading graph. We then analyzed the risk of fire spreading to cultural properties from both the macro and micro perspectives according to the number of configuration nodes for the DVF buffer and graph. We found that the majority of cultural properties at high risk of fire spreading are folk dwellings and Japanese traditional town houses and that many are distributed in areas of high-density wood construction.

TOWARDS BUILDING A SEMANTIC FORMALIZATION OF (SMALL) HISTORICAL CENTRES	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF GEOMATICS AND RESTORATION (GEORES 2019)	International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference of Geomatics and Restoration (GEORES)	MAY 08-10, 2019	Milan, ITALY	Carleton Univ, Carleton Immers Media Studio, Microgeo Srl, GEOMAX Srl, STONEX Srl		Semantic features; spatial objects; urban mapping; spatial reasoning; ontology; small historical urban centres	DATA ENRICHMENT	Historical small urban centres are of increasing interest to different interacting fields such as architectural heritage protection and conservation, urban planning, disaster response, sustainable development and tourism. They are defined at different levels (international, national, regional), by various organizations and standards, incorporate numerous aspects (natural and built environment, infrastructures and open spaces, social, economic, and cultural processes, tangible and intangible heritage) and face various challenges (urbanization, globalization, mass tourism, climate change, etc.). However, their current specification within large-scale geospatial databases is similar to those of urban areas in a broad sense resulting in the loss of many aspects forming this multifaceted concept. The present study considers the available ontologies and data models, coming from various domains and having different granularities and levels of detail, to represent historical small urban centres information. The aim is to define the needs for extension and integration of them in order to develop a multidisciplinary, integrated semantic representation. Relevant conventions and other legislation documents, ontologies and standards for cultural heritage (CIDOC-CRM, CRMgeo, Getty Vocabularies), 3D city models (CityGML), building information models (IFC) and regional landscape plans are analysed to identify concepts, relations, and semantic features that could form a holistic semantic model of historical small urban centres.

J	Peter, N; Afrin, N; Goh, G; Chester, E				Peter, Nicolas; Afrin, Nadia; Goh, Gerardine; Chester, Ed			Space technology, sustainable development and community applications: Internet as a facilitator	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	56th International Astronautical Congress	OCT 17-21, 2005	Fukuoka, JAPAN	Int Astronaut Federat				Among other approaches, space technologies are currently being deployed for disaster management, environmental monitoring, urban planning, health applications, communications, etc. Although space-based applications have tremendous potential for socioeconomic development, they are primarily technology driven and the requirements from the end-users (i.e. the development community) are rarely taken into consideration during the initial development stages. This communication gap between the "space" and "development" communities can be bridged with the help of the web-based knowledge sharing portal focused on space applications for development. This online community uses the development gateway foundation's sophisticated content management system. It is modeled after the development gateway's knowledge sharing portals (http://topics.developmentgateway.org) and draws from their expertise in knowledge management, partnership building and marketing. These types of portal are known to facilitate broad-based partnerships across sectors, regions and the various stakeholders but also to facilitate North-South and South-South cooperation. This paper describes the initiative "Space for Development" (http://topics.developmentgateway.org/space) started in 2004 which aims to demonstrate how such a web-based portal can be structured to facilitate knowledge sharing in order to bridge the gap between the "space" and "development" communities in an innovative and global manner.

Although deep neural networks have shown a strong ability in road extraction, it remains a challenging task due to complex circumstances and factors such as occlusion. To improve the accuracy and connectivity of road extraction, we propose an inner convolution integrated encoder-decoder network with the post-processing of directional conditional random fields. Firstly, we design an inner convolutional network which can propagate information slice-by-slice within feature maps, thus enhancing the learning of road topology and linear features. Additionally, we present the directional conditional random fields to improve the quality of the extracted road by adding the direction of roads to the energy function of the conditional random fields. The experimental results on the Massachusetts road dataset show that the proposed approach achieves high-quality segmentation results, with the F1-score of 84.6%, which outperforms other comparable "state-of-the-art" approaches. The visualization results prove that the proposed approach is able to effectively extract roads from remote sensing images and can solve the road connectivity problem produced by occlusions to some extent.

For this, there is the need of a high level Computational Intelligence based classifier for the perfect use of land cover features. Computational Intelligence explodes its area based on Swarm Intelligence, Modelization of human mind, nature inspired and some other intelligent techniques. From these major categories, we included Artificial Bee Colony optimization, Cuckoo Search, Rough Set, Fuzzy Set, Membrane Computing, Minimum Distance Classifier and Maximum Likelihood Classifier for the comparison classification of Alwar region, India. Kappa coefficient is taken as acceptance estimation parameter. User's accuracy & Producer's accuracy are considered to check the accuracy of a solitary land feature. In this paper, we want to scrutinize that which computational Intelligence based classifiers give appropriate results under same circumstances to optimize this land features.

In recent years, convolutional neural networks have made outstanding achievements in improving the precision of building extraction. However, most existing approaches have some problems, such as insufficient detailed feature extraction and ignorance of the relationship between different features. In this study, we propose a novel multi-channel recurrent attention network (MCANet) for building extraction. Firstly, the multi-scale channel attention mechanism is used to expand the convolution kernel receptive field, making the model can extract rich building region feature information. Secondly, we use the spatial pyramid recurrent block to establish long-range dependencies over space, channel, and layer of different convolutions. Finally, the multi-channel feature fusion block is used to fuse the multi-scale channel features information, and improve the building extraction precision. Experimental results show that the proposed MCANet achieves better results (recall, precision, intersection-over-union, and F-1_score on the Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset are 89.82%, 94.38%, 87.42%, and 88.25%, respectively), and outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches.

Rivers provide water supply for domestic, industrial and irrigation uses; they also provide convenient means for navigation, transportation and communication. Cities have large percentage of impervious areas that prevent effective infiltration of rainfall into soil. To have successful flood control and flood risk management, we should consider not only hydraulic and engineering aspects but also socio-economic and environment aspects. Flood management should have involvement of various stakeholders including concerned authorities such as urban planners, civil and water resources engineers, civil disaster defence authorities, health and social services, etc. The best flood mitigation measures from all main points of view - social, economic and environmental are natural water retention measures. Natural water retention measures cover a diversity of measures that are implemented by different sectors or considered in different planning processes dealing with water, food risk management, biodiversity protection, climate change adaptation or urban planning. Some of these measures aim to directly modify the ecosystem, while others focus on changes of practice of economic operators. The paper presents natural water retention measures suitable for application in urban areas. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with the traditional building extraction approaches, deep learning networks have recently shown outstanding performance in this task by using both high-level and low-level feature maps. However, it is difficult to utilize different level features rationally with the present deep learning networks. To tackle this problem, a novel network based on DenseNets and the attention mechanism was proposed, called the dense-attention network (DAN). The DAN contains an encoder part and a decoder part which are separately composed of lightweight DenseNets and a spatial attention fusion module. The proposed encoder-decoder architecture can strengthen feature propagation and effectively bring higher-level feature information to suppress the low-level feature and noises. Experimental results based on public international society for photogrammetry and remote sensing (ISPRS) datasets with only red-green-blue (RGB) images demonstrated that the proposed DAN achieved a higher score (96.16% overall accuracy (OA), 92.56% F1 score, 90.56% mean intersection over union (MIOU), less training and response time and higher-quality value) when compared with other deep learning methods.

J	Comerio, MC				Comerio, Mary C.			Housing Recovery Lessons From Chile	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION			English	Article						recovery; urban planning; resilience; housing; reconstruction		Problem, research strategy and findings: The 8.8 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck south-central Chile on February 27, 2010, affected 75% of the country's population and damaged or destroyed 370,000 housing units (about 10% of the housing in six regions). Within six months, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development published a plan to repair or rebuild 220,000 units of low- and middle-income housing with government assistance within four years. By February 2014, 94% of the housing was complete. The successful rebuilding effort had strong leadership at the national and local levels and used existing programs and institutions. The management staff adapted programs over time to meet the needs of local conditions. When compared with housing recovery programs in other countries, Chile's program stands out, combining national government management with local citizen input. The reconstruction plan also included updated zoning plans, road and infrastructure improvements, heritage recovery, and new master plans for affected cities. Going forward, the earthquake created an opportunity for Chile to use the recovery planning to expand national urban policy and to develop a framework for citizen participation at the local level. Takeaway for practice: Successful planning in disaster recovery involves strong government leadership and coordination together with the engagement of local government and the participation of citizens.

Given the increasing demand for population grid with improved quality, this study explores the feasibility of generating high-resolution (100m) population grids in the Conterminous U.S. (CONUS) using a total of 125 million building footprints recently released by Microsoft. Those building footprints were used to disaggregate census tract population of the latest ACS 5-year estimates (2013-2017). Land use dataset from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) was applied to trim raw buildings footprints by removing those that are not likely residential. Weighting scenarios were designed, with which a dasymetric model was applied to disaggregate the ACS census tract estimates into a 100m population grid product. The results suggest that building footprints as a weighting layer, particularly footprint size after trimming, outperforms other commonly used weighting layers and is able to capture the great heterogeneity of population distribution at the micro-level. This study provides valuable experience in developing high-resolution population grid products that can benefit a wide range of studies in need of spatially explicit population data.

Traditionally, the assessment of disaster impact has primarily relied on the manual collection and analysis of surveys and questionnaires as well as the review of authority reports. This can be costly and time-consuming, whereas a timely assessment of an event's impact is critical for crisis management and humanitarian operations. In this work, we formulate the impact discovery as the problem to identify the shared and discriminative subspace via tensor factorization due to the multi-dimensional nature of mobility data. Existing work in mining the shared and discriminative subspaces typically requires the predefined number of either type of them. In the context of event impact discovery, this could be impractical, especially for those unprecedented events. To overcome this, we propose a new framework, called "PairFac," that jointly factorizes the multi-dimensional data to discover the latent mobility pattern along with its associated discriminative weight. This framework does not require splitting the shared and discriminative subspaces in advance and at the same time automatically captures the persistent and changing patterns from multi-dimensional behavioral data. Our work has important applications in crisis management and urban planning, which provides a timely assessment of impacts of major events in the urban environment.

However, they are computationally expensive and, thus, time consuming, while some of the applications, such as natural disaster monitoring and prevention, require high efficiency performance. Fortunately, parallel computing techniques and embedded systems have made great progress in recent years, and a series of massively parallel image processing devices, such as digital signal processors or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), have been made available to engineers at a very convenient price and demonstrate significant advantages in terms of running-cost, embeddability, power consumption flexibility, etc. In this work, we designed a texture region segmentation method for very high resolution satellite images by using the level set algorithm and the multi-kernel theory in a high-abstraction C environment and realize its register-transfer level implementation with the help of a new proposed high-level synthesis-based design flow. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that the proposed design can produce high quality image segmentation with a significant running-cost advantage.

However, existing identification methods do not always correctly recognize all building functions because of missing point of interest (POI) data in private areas. In this study, we proposed a hierarchical data-mining model to identify building function types using accessible auxiliary data, which was then applied to a case study. Residential building property was assessed to address missing residential POIs. The building functions were assigned to one of five different types, or a mixed-function type. Standard deviation and mean values extracted from remotely sensed images, distances to major roads, and building shape parameters were used to infer the function types of buildings without assigned function types. The proposed model was able to identify 65% of buildings not previously assigned as residential through the POI, with an overall accuracy of 87%. In addition, all buildings were successfully assigned a function type of residential, commercial, office, warehouse, public service, or mixed-function, with an overall accuracy of 85% for unclassified buildings. Our results demonstrated that missing POI data in private areas could be addressed by integration with multisource data using a simple method.

This paper addresses the effective use of BIM in urban context based on the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for training, planning and utilizing crisis management activities. The proposed solution integrates the domain ontologies associated with BIM and GIS at building and urban level to filter the useful data and use that filtered data to increase the public awareness for better crisis and disaster preparedness by interactive gaming. The proposed proof of concept study presents an IoT-enabled Virtual Reality (VR) environment that relies on the visual data obtained from the BIM and GIS and also sensory inputs accumulated from the building or urban layout. Such visual layouts of buildings and their surrounding areas are presented in a layered format, considering the security and privacy concerns, to identify the safe and dangerous zones on the evacuation route starting from a person's private residential area, e.g. home, and ends at a crisis gathering point (e.g. Points of Interest, PoI). The use case presented in this study simulates an earthquake and fire scenario in a VR environment.

For the demands of accurate road information in practical applications such as urban planning and disaster assessment, we propose a multiscale method to extract road network from high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which consists of three stages: potential road area segmentation, preliminary network generation, and road network refinement. Multiscale analysis is implemented using an image pyramid framework together with a fixed-size filter. First, a directional road detector is designed to highlight road targets in feature response maps. Subsequently, adaptive fusion is performed independently at each image scale, followed by a threshold method to produce potential road maps. Then, binary maps are decomposed according to the obtained direction information. For each connected component (CC), quality evaluation is conducted to further distinguish road segments and polynomial curve fitting is adopted as a thinning method. Multiscale information fusion is realized through the weighted sum of road curves. Finally, tensor voting and spatial regularization are employed to generate the final road network. Experiments on three TerraSAR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to extract road network completely and correctly.

Image recognition and image location in environmental monitoring has become an academic hotspot in the field of computer vision. Convolution neural network model is the most commonly used image processing model. Compared with the traditional artificial neural network model, convolution neural network has more hidden layers. Its unique convolution and pooling operations have higher efficiency in image processing. It has incomparable advantages in image recognition and location and other forms of two-dimensional graphics tasks. As a new deformation of convolution neural network, residual neural network aims to make convolution layer learn a kind of residual instead of a direct learning goal. After analyzing the characteristics of CNN model for image feature representation and residual network, a residual network model is built. The UAV remote sensing system is selected as the platform to acquire image data, and the problem of image recognition based on residual neural network is studied, which is verified by experiment simulation and precision analysis. Finally, the problems and experiences in the process of learning and designing are discussed, and the future improvements in the field of image target location and recognition are prospected.

In framing land subsidence as a classic 'wicked' policy problem, and also as a hybrid geological and anthropogenic phenomenon that is unevenly experienced across urban contexts, the paper uses a three-step analysis. First, satellite-derived InSAR maps are integrated with Sentinel-1A data in order to reveal the socio-temporal variability of subsidence rates which in turn pose challenges in uniformly applying regulatory action. Second, a multi-sectoral mapping of diverse policies and practices spanning urban water supply, groundwater extraction, land use zoning, building codes, tenurial security, and land reclamation reveal the extent to which the broader coastal governance landscape remains fragmented and incongruous, particularly in arresting a multi-dimensional phenomenon such as subsidence. Finally, in reference to distinct coastal identities of each city-the 'Sinking Capital' (Jakarta), 'Fortress Singapore', and the 'Disaster Capital' (Manila) the paper illustrates how land subsidence is portrayed across the three metropolises in markedly similar ways: as a reversible, quasi-natural, and/or a highly individualized problem.

The data produced from them can be utilized to derive the spatio-temporal information of their users' whereabouts. We can obtain a rich data set of human activities, interactions, social relationships, and mobility. Hence, it has been possible to explore these information sources with applications ranging from disaster management to disease epidemiology. In this paper, we have focused on the use of call detail records to explore and interpret patterns embedded in interaction flows of people through their mobile phone calls. To do so, we consider the geographical context of subscribers/celltowers to discover structures of spatio-temporal interactions and communities' patterns in Macau. We have explored the inter and intra-polygon interaction flows. The results suggest that subscribers tend to communicate within a spatial-proximity community. In order to delineate relatively contiguous objects with similar attribute values, we have implemented an efficient hierarchical clustering approach. By identifying key objects and their close associates and exploring their communication patterns, we can detect shared interests and dominant interactions that influence societal patterns. Such insight is useful for resource optimization in network planning, content distribution, and urban planning.

In particular, extracting buildings that cannot be sheltered in emergency shelters can help establish and improve a city's overall disaster prevention system. However, small building extraction often involves problems, such as integrity, missed and false detection, and blurred boundaries. In this study, EfficientUNet+, an improved building extraction method from remote sensing images based on the UNet model, is proposed. This method uses EfficientNet-b0 as the encoder and embeds the spatial and channel squeeze and excitation (scSE) in the decoder to realize forward correction of features and improve the accuracy and speed of model extraction. Next, for the problem of blurred boundaries, we propose a joint loss function of building boundary-weighted cross-entropy and Dice loss to enforce constraints on building boundaries. Finally, model pretraining is performed using the WHU aerial building dataset with a large amount of data. The transfer learning method is used to complete the high-precision extraction of buildings with few training samples in specific scenarios. We created a Google building image dataset of emergency shelters within the Fifth Ring Road of Beijing and conducted experiments to verify the effectiveness of the method in this study. The proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods, namely, DeepLabv3+, PSPNet, ResUNet, and HRNet. The results show that the EfficientUNet+ method is superior in terms of Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mean intersection over union (mIoU). The accuracy of the EfficientUNet+ method for each index is the highest, reaching 93.01%, 89.17%, 91.05%, and 90.97%, respectively. This indicates that the method proposed in this study can effectively extract buildings in emergency shelters and has an important reference value for guiding urban emergency evacuation.

Investigating the response of urban traffic conditions during storm surges and discovering sensitive urban areas are crucial to urban planning, disaster prevention, and emergency rescue. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of typhoons on taxi operations to target sensitive areas of the city. In this study, the change in taxi service operation in Shenzhen during typhoon storm surges from 2012 to 2014 was explored at the city district scale using a diverse set of data including taxi trajectory data, typhoon track data, and tide level data. Several aspects were included to access this impact, for example the number of daily orders per taxi, the trip length, the degree of closeness to the typhoon-affected area, the coverage area of the taxi service, and the spatial dynamics of the origin and destination matrix. The regular trend and correlation of storm surge elements and taxi parameters were first analyzed. The distribution of the taxi trajectory data was then used to detect variations in the service area, and the reasons for these variations were discussed. The result shows that storm surges with diverse characteristics do affect taxi operations to differing degrees, and that there was a potential correlation between tide level and taxi service area. The sensitive areas for taxis during typhoon storm surges were mainly located at the boundary between the central urban area and other districts of Shenzhen, they were constrained by the dynamic changes in the origins and destinations, and they were likely related to important transportation hubs in the city. This finding provides a reference to support disaster prevention preparedness and decision-making by local authorities.

J	Sengezer, B; Koc, E				Sengezer, B; Koc, E			A critical analysis of earthquakes and urban planning in Turkey	DISASTERS			English	Article						earthquake; hazard mitigation; land use planning; vulnerability		The land use plans and policies of developed countries that live with the threat of earthquakes are gaining importance in reducing or eliminating the long-term threat to people and property. In developing countries, however, these plans and policies seem to increase the level of vulnerability. This paper examines the effects of the earthquakes that have occurred in Turkey since 1992, with a particular focus on urbanisation and planning policies. It is based on extensive surveys carried out on location immediately after the earthquakes in Erzincan and Kocaeli-Golcuk in 1992 and 1999, respectively. The analysis takes into account several factors, including the height of buildings, geological conditions and the construction period. The authors conclude that land use planning can serve as a very useful instrument for mitigating the extent of disaster damage if it is part of an appropriate planning system. In the case of Turkey, the planning system needs to be reorganised for this purpose.The land use plans and policies of developed countries that live with the threat of earthquakes are gaining importance in reducing or eliminating the long-term threat to people and property.

In this study, we focus on simulating earthquake engineering parameters by the empirical Green's function method. The simulated earthquake (MJMA6.5) occurred in Kyushu, Japan, 1997. Horizontal ground motion is separated as fault parallel and fault normal, in order to assess characteristics of two new direction components. Broadband frequency range of ground motion simulation is from 0.1 to 20 Hz. Through comparing observed parameters and synthetic parameters, we analyzed distribution characteristics of earthquake engineering parameters. From the comparison, the simulated waveform has high similarity with the observed waveform. We found the following. (1) Near-field PGA attenuates radically all around with strip radiation patterns in fault parallel while radiation patterns of fault normal is circular; PGV has a good similarity between observed record and synthetic record, but has different distribution characteristic in different components. (2) Rupture direction and terrain have a large influence on 90 % significant duration. (3) Arias Intensity is attenuating with increasing epicenter distance. Observed values have a high similarity with synthetic values. (4) Predominant period is very different in the part of Kyushu in fault normal. It is affected greatly by site conditions. (5) Most parameters have good reference values where the hypo-central is less than 35 km. (6) The GOF values of all these parameters are generally higher than 45 which means a good result according to Olsen's classification criterion. Not all parameters can fit well. Given these synthetic ground motion parameters, seismic hazard analysis can be performed and earthquake disaster analysis can be conducted in future urban planning.

The case of Boca Sur (San Pedro de la Paz, Chile)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Coast; Urbanization; Tsunami; Evacuation; Land-use planning; Least-cost-distance model land cover	POPULATION EXPOSURE; DISASTER; HAZARDS; MODEL; RISK; SCENARIOS; IQUIQUE; PADANG; SLIP; CITY	The destructive potential of a massive tsunami is not only related to society's response capacity and evacuation plans, but also to the urban morphology and land cover. The Boca Sur neighborhood is one of the areas in central Chile that is most exposed to tsunamis, and it is framed in the context of increasing urban growth. Faced with the worst tsunami scenario (earthquake Mw = 9.0), residents' evacuation potential is analyzed by using a least-cost-distance model, and two scenarios of land cover change are considered (2002 and 2018). Presently, the sector's urban areas have grown by 83%, therefore its population has also grown. The evacuation times consider an average walking speed (1.22 m/s) for both years (2002 and 2018). This analysis establishes that over 40% of the study area is more than 60 min away from the safe zones established by authorities. This differs greatly from the 22-min average tsunami arrival time. Moreover, 19% of the area could not be evacuated in less than 30 min. Therefore, it can be concluded that the increased urbanization in the coastal area has not improved travel times, as urban planning did not consider the optimization of evacuation times to the designated safe zones. In this study, we propose new safe zones that would help reducing evacuation times to 30 min. In addition to the area's high tsunami risk, the evacuated population's strong travel time limitations are added, prioritizing the incorporation of social and urban resilience elements that help to effectively reduce the risk of disaster, by using land-use planning and community work.

J	Anhorn, J; Lennartz, T; Nusser, M				Anhorn, Johannes; Lennartz, Thomas; Nuesser, Marcus			RAPID URBAN GROWTH AND EARTHQUAKE RISK IN MUSIKOT, MID-WESTERN HILLS, NEPAL	ERDKUNDE			English	Article						Earthquake; natural hazard; risk management; urban development; Nepal	LANDSCAPE TRANSFORMATION; KASHMIR EARTHQUAKE; DISASTER RISK; RC BUILDINGS; VULNERABILITY; MEGACITIES; REDUCTION; PAKISTAN; HAZARDS; RESILIENCE	The rapid urban development of Musikot from a small bazaar settlement to a mid-size trade and service centre in rural Nepal increases the vulnerability of its inhabitants to natural hazards. Population growth and improved road accessibility has led to increased construction and an expansion and alteration of the built environment. The growing availability of modern construction materials like concrete and steel allows for new architectural designs and the erection of additional storeys on existing buildings, which contributes to the instability of the building stock. The aftermath of the April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake demonstrates the severe consequences of such haphazard construction practices in seismically active locations. A lack of implementation and enforcement of regulatory frameworks for building construction and spatial planning raises the risks for the local population. Taking Musikot as a characteristic case study of rapid urban change, this article analyses it's increasing local earthquake-risk in light of insufficient seismic building code implementation and risk-sensitive urban planning. Applying an approach that combines repeat photography and field mapping, the urban development of Musikot and the increasing fragility of the building stock are assessed using a modified seismic evaluation scheme for local building types. Almost one fourth of all construction was found to be at high risk of damage to earthquakes. It is argued, that without proper training in earthquake resistant construction techniques and awareness campaigns, the (mal-)adoption of modern construction materials will amplify earthquake risk in rural centres. This study stresses the need to broaden the research of disaster risk reduction and adequate adaptation strategies beyond the current focus on large agglomerations to include rapidly urbanising small settlements in rural areas, which are all too often neglected.

The aim is to reveal the pathways and trade-offs through which governance and planning systems interactions constrain or open opportunities for transformative resilience to the challenges posed by urbanization and migration dynamics. To proactively deal with the new requirements emerging from urbanization, climate change, migration, and their associated challenges on cities, the resilience narrative is discussed by examining the guiding discourses on resilience in the context of urban and regional planning. The comparative case study method is based on the 'Most Different Systems Design' to analyze the heterogeneous governance and planning systems and examine transformative resilience as their common challenge. The findings from the case study analysis revealed the associated strengths and weaknesses of the established governance processes (decentralized v.s centralized) and planning systems (performing v.s conforming) to drive the transition toward transformative resilience. Recommendations stress the need for reorganization of governance structures and reorientation of planning frameworks in the context of increasing complexities induced by urbanization and migration dynamics.

Automatic building footprint extraction from very high-resolution imagery using deep learning techniques	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Convolutional Neural Network; SegNet; UNet; UNet-AP	REMOTE-SENSING IMAGERY; SCALE	Building footprint maps are useful for urban planning, infrastructural development, population estimation and disaster management. With the availability of very-high resolution satellite imagery, remote sensing community is pursuing automatic techniques for extracting building footprints for cities with varried building types. Recently, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Network) have been successfully applied for extraction of building footprint from satellite imagery. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture termed UNet-AP inspired by UNet and the concept of Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling, for automatic extraction of building footprint from very-high resolution satellite imagery. We demonstrate extraction of building footprints from Cartosat-2 series 4-band (Blue, Green, Red and Near-Infrared) multispectral satellite imagery, pan-sharpened using the panchromatic image with less than 1-meter resolution. We also compare the performance of our proposed architecture with baseline implementation of recently proposed UNet and SegNet architectures. We present a comparative assessment of the architecture performance across different types of urban settlement classes such as dense built-up areas, slums and isolated buildings. We demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms SegNet and UNet in terms of overall mean intersection over union (0.75 vs 0.70 and 0.68 for UNet and SegNet respectively) and delivers consistent improvement across all three settlement classes.

It is of great significance in urban emergency response, disaster assessment, resource allocation, urban planning, market research, and transportation route design. This study employed land cover, building address, and housing price data, and high-resolution stereo pair remote sensing images to simulate fine-scale urban population distribution. We firstly extracted the residential zones on the basis of land cover and Google Earth data, combined them with building information including address and price. Then, we employed the stereo pair analysis method to obtain the building height on the basis of ZY3-02 high-resolution satellite data and transform the building height into building floors. After that, we built a sophisticated, high spatial resolution model of population density. Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of the model using the survey data from 12 communities in the study area. Results demonstrated that the proposed model for spatial fine-scale urban population products yielded more accurate small-area population estimation relative to high-resolution gridded population surface (HGPS).

Satellite remote sensing images are the most important data source for urban geographical maps. However, for optical satellite remote sensing images with high spatial resolution, certain inevitable factors, including cloud, haze, and cloud shadow, severely degrade the image quality. Moreover, the geometrical and radiometric differences amongst multiple high-spatial-resolution images are difficult to eliminate. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient procedure for generating high-resolution and high-quality seamless satellite imagery for large-scale urban regions. This procedure consists of image registration, cloud detection, thin/thick cloud removal, pansharpening, and mosaicking processes. Methodologically, a spatially adaptive method considering the variation of atmospheric scattering, and a stepwise replacement method based on local moment matching are proposed for removing thin and thick clouds, respectively. The effectiveness is demonstrated by a successful case of generating a 0.91-m-resolution image of the main city zone in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, using images obtained from the Chinese Beijing-2 and Gaofen-2 high-resolution satellites.

J	Moreira, MAB				Barcia Moreira, Manuel Alejandro			The Catalog of Protections as a normative figure for the protection of the architectural heritage of the Historic Center of Portoviejo	REVISTA SAN GREGORIO			Spanish	Article						central core; Portoviejo cultural heritage; protection catalog; traditional architecture		The present article starts from the descriptive research that aimed to know the current situation of the architectural heritage in Portoviejo, to delimit the urban area that has a high historical, cultural and landscape value in relation to the existing heritage properties and of greater relevance, by calling this space the Traditional Central Core. The conservation status of this built heritage was analyzed, by delving into what happened after the earthquake on April 16, 2016, its incidents and the mechanisms of action against the disaster. The current complex legal and regulatory situation by regarding architectural cultural heritage in Ecuador was studied, and the possible implementation of new tools or instruments such as the Catalog of Protections, not yet contemplated in this country for the protection of built heritage, such as a mandatory figure in the regulation on cultural heritage and urban planning. This instrument for the protection and management of architectural heritage aims to articulate in a coherent way the conservation of the built heritage, through the regulation and control of acts of intervention, focused on their preservation and maintenance; by preventing the disappearance or inappropriate transformation of real estate, urban complexes and spaces with relevant values and attributes for the canton.

The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction program is asking cities 'How resilient is your city'. The ITA Committee on Underground Space (ITACUS) is working together with UNISDR to demonstrate how the use of underground space can contribute to making cities more resilient. The use of underground space is underrated worldwide, yet it can prove to be invaluable to city governments as a strategic planning asset. This paper explores the issues and shows how underground space is already contributing. The main focus will be on those aspects that help cities cope with rapid urbanization and their efforts to become more resilient. Areas which will be explored include buildings, transport, energy supply, water and waste. The question will also be raised whether the use of underground space can take place as an autonomous activity or whether planning the use of underground space is required. In the opinion of the author the latter is the case. City governments require awareness of both the advantages of underground space use but also of the need to plan using this asset in a sustainable way. Only in that way will the use of underground space be to the advantage of cities.

In addition to these, the article studies the relationship among the urban ecosystem and the building ecosystem, the planning and design integrated ecology, the method of interdisciplinary working. This article also argues the problems of ecological safety strategies in the urban planning and the architecture design, and the main contents of ecological safety strategies under the concept of low-carbon strategy. From a whole urban ecosystem, to a building ecosystem, some strategies of eco-city planning and ecological safety design are studied. It includes the strategies of urban environment and sustainable development under the principle in low-carbon strategy, which is in conflict with rapid economies and ecological conservation.

J	Mehrabi, M; Moayedi, H				Mehrabi, Mohammad; Moayedi, Hossein			Landslide susceptibility mapping using artificial neural network tuned by metaheuristic algorithms	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Natural hazard; Landslide; Susceptibility modeling; Machine learning; Metaheuristic optimization	WATER CYCLE ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SPATIAL PREDICTION; ENTROPY MODELS; RANDOM FOREST; ENSEMBLE; SEARCH; COUNTY; INDEX	As a frequent natural disaster, landslides incur significant economic and human losses worldwide. The main idea of this paper is to propose novel integrative models for landslide susceptibility evaluation in a prone area of Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari Province in Iran. To do this, four metaheuristic techniques, namely chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), crow search algorithm (CSA), satin bowerbird optimization (SBO), and water cycle algorithm (WCA) are used to supervise the training of an artificial neural network (ANN). A spatial database is created by 170 historical landslides and 14 most common conditioning factors. The models are optimized in terms of hyper-parameters and elite ones are then used to produce the susceptibility maps. During the training phase, all models could acquire a reliable understanding of the landslide pattern. The obtained accuracy index of area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that the maps produced by the WCA-ANN (AUROC = 0.925) and SBO-ANN (AUROC = 0.900) are more accurate than those of the ChOA-ANN (AUROC = 0.851) and CSA-ANN (AUROC = 0.855). Considering this assessment, the suggested hybrid models are reliable enough for landslide susceptibility modeling. Accordingly, the generated susceptibility map can be used for urban planning and generating alert systems over the studied area.

J	Wang, NL; Zeng, XY				Wang Nanlan; Zeng Xiaoyong			Hyperspectral Data Classification Algorithm considering Spatial Texture Features	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							SPARSE REGRESSION	As a cutting-edge technology, hyperspectral remote sensing has been widely applied in many fields, including agricultural production, mineral identification, target detection, disaster warning, military reconnaissance, and urban planning. The collected hyperspectral data have high spectral resolution and spatial resolution and are characterized by a large amount of information, redundancy, and high dimension. At the same time, there is a strong correlation between the bands. Therefore, hyperspectral data not only provides rich information but also brings great challenges for subsequent processing. Hyperspectral image classification is a hot issue in remote sensing information processing. Traditional hyperspectral remote sensing image classification methods only use the spectral features of the image without considering the spatial features of each pixel in the hyperspectral remote sensing image. In this paper, a hyperspectral image classification method is proposed not only considering spectral features but also considering texture features. This method jointly considers both these features. Firstly, six texture features contributing a lot to each pixel of hyperspectral remote sensing image are extracted by using a gray level cooccurrence matrix, and then, the spectral features of each pixel in neighbor are combined to form the texture-spectral features. Finally, the classification experiment of the Indian Pines and Pavia University scene is carried out based on a support vector machine and extreme random tree algorithm, and the obtained results show that the proposed method achieves higher classification performance than the traditional method.

For example, through closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, crowd counting and abnormal event recognition can be realized. However, most of these applications are limited within the 2D coordinate system of each single camera, lacking a unified understanding of the 3D world as a whole. In addition, overly simple functionalities, such as framing certain areas or displaying text, limit the system intelligence and user experience. This article proposes a solution of realtime 3D visualization of outdoor scenes enabled by AI and the Visual Internet of Things (V-IoT). First, fixed and airborne cameras, infrared cameras, LiDAR, gas sensors, and so on are deployed to collect multi-modal data and send them to the clouds. Then AI algorithms are executed in the clouds to calculate the location of people, vehicles, and other moving objects, and to detect fights, stampedes, fire, or other abnormal events. Finally, the clouds send the AI algorithm results to the visualization system in terminal devices. The system displays the scene in real time through 3D animation and charts, and provides user interaction interfaces and simulation functionalities in a gamification environment. Experiments show that the proposed solution realistically visualizes the real world to sup-nort the user's decision.

An integrated physics-based multi-hazard simulation framework covering both individual buildings and urban areas can help improve analysis efficiency and is significant for urban planning and emergency management activities. Therefore, a city information model-powered multi-hazard simulation framework is proposed considering three types of hazards (i.e., earthquake, fire, and wind hazards). The proposed framework consists of three modules: (1) data transformation, (2) physics-based hazard analysis, and (3) high-fidelity visualization. Three advantages are highlighted: (1) the database with multi-scale models is capable of meeting the various demands of stakeholders, (2) hazard analyses are all based on physics-based models, leading to rational and scientific simulations, and (3) high-fidelity visualization can help non-professional users better understand the disaster scenario. A case study of the Tsinghua University campus is performed. The results indicate the proposed framework is a practical method for multi-hazard simulations of both individual buildings and urban areas and has great potential in helping stakeholders to assess and recognize the risks faced by important buildings or the whole city.

J	Celik, HZ; Cilingir, T				Celik, Hayat Zengin; Cilingir, Tolga			The Urban Cost of Parcel-Based Transformation: The Case of Karsiyaka-Bostanli Neighborhood	PLANLAMA-PLANNING			Turkish	Article						Karsiyaka-Bostanli; renewal; urban transformation; urban technical and social Infrastructure; quality of life	QUALITY	"Urban transformation" is now often presented as an inevitable stage of urban evolution, and urban land is entirely offered up to the capital market. Legal regulations are also created in order to provide authorization for these plans or to ease their implementation. Although it is clear that the urbanization of Turkey is a historical problem and that it is related to economic strategies at the local and the macro level, it is important that the consequences of such transformation be understood. At this point, it is essential to examine the socio-spatial outcomes and urban cost created by not only Article 73 of Municipal Law No. 5393, which allocated responsibility for decisions related to urbanization and urban development to the municipalities and the Housing Development Administration of Turkey, but also parcel-based implementation under "The Law of Transformation of Areas Under Disaster Risks," No. 6306. This study examined the circumstances in the Izmir neighborhood of Bostanli, where the implementation of parcel-based renewal has accelerated. The resulting population change, as well as a change in the physical density of the buildings and changes in the urban technological and social infrastructure that have occurred were evaluated from the urban planning perspective and on the basis of quality of life.

Fusion of ALS Point Cloud and Optical Imagery for 3D Reconstruction of Building's Roof	SMPR CONFERENCE 2013	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Sensors and Models in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (SMPR)	OCT 05-08, 2013	Univ Tehran, Tehran, IRAN	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing	Univ Tehran	Reconstruction; Building; LiDAR; Image; Segmentation; Mean-Shift	MODEL RECONSTRUCTION; LIDAR DATA	Three-dimensional building models are important in various applications such as disaster management and urban planning. In this paper a method based on fusion of LiDAR point cloud and aerial image data sources has been proposed. Firstly using 2D map, the point set relevant to each building separated from the overall LiDAR point cloud. In the next step, the mean shift clustering algorithm applied to the points of different buildings in the feature space. Finally the segmentation stage ended with the separation of parallel and coplanar segments. Then using the adjacency matrix, adjacent segments are intersected and inner vertices are determined. In the other space, the area of any building cropped in the image space and the mean shift algorithm applied to it. Then, the lines of roof's outline edge extracted by the Hough transform algorithm and the points obtained from the intersection of these lines transformed to the ground space. Finally, by integration of structural points of intersected adjacent facets and the transformed points from image space, reconstruction performed. In order to evaluate the efficiency of proposed method, buildings with different shapes and different level of complexity selected and the results of the 3D model reconstruction evaluated. The results showed credible efficiency of method for different buildings.

O-SegNet: Robust Encoder and Decoder Architecture for Objects Segmentation From Aerial Imagery Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Roads; Computer architecture; Semantics; Decoding; Buildings; Segmentation; aerial images; self-attention; GA blocks	REMOTE-SENSING IMAGES; MAN-MADE OBJECTS; SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION; ROAD EXTRACTION; NETWORKS	The segmentation of diversified roads and buildings from high-resolution aerial images is essential for various applications, such as urban planning, disaster assessment, traffic congestion management, and up-to-date road maps. However, a major challenge during object segmentation is the segmentation of small-sized, diverse shaped roads, and buildings in dominant background scenarios. We introduce O-SegNet- the robust encoder and decoder architecture for objects segmentation from high-resolution aerial imagery data to address this challenge. The proposed O-SegNet architecture contains Guided-Attention (GA) blocks in the encoder and decoder to focus on salient features by representing the spatial dependencies between features of different scales. Further, GA blocks guide the successive stages of encoder and decoder by interrelating the pixels of the same class. To emphasize more on relevant context, the attention mechanism is provided between encoder and decoder after aggregating the global context via an 8 Level Pyramid Pooling Network (PPN). The qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed and existing semantic segmentation architectures are evaluated by utilizing the dataset provided by Kaiser et al. Further, we show that the proposed O-SegNet architecture outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by accurately preserving the road connectivity and structure of buildings.

This paper proposes a new urban extraction method for PolSAR data. First, a multiple-component model-based decomposition method, which was previously proposed by us, is applied to detect the urban areas using the scattering powers. Second, with the sub-aperture decomposition, a new average polarimetric coherence coefficient ratio is proposed to discriminate the urban and natural areas. Finally, these two preliminary detection results are fused on the decision level to improve the overall detection accuracy. We validate our method using one dataset acquired with the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) system. Experimental results demonstrate that the decomposed scattering powers and the proposed polarimetric coherence coefficient ratio are both capable of distinguishing urban areas from natural areas with accuracy about 83.1% and 80.1%, respectively. The overall detection accuracy can further increase to 86.9% with the fusion of two detection results.

The aim of this research is to build a framework of knowledge to integrate perspectives of natural risk resilience (natural risk, cultural heritage, communities, spatial resources, and spatial planning) tested on research cases in areas affected by earthquakes in Italy and Croatia. The Heritage Urbanism approach is applied by comparing the Central Italy disaster and trends in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, providing identity factors and evaluation criteria to assist in reading existing resilience models and building new models. Structures to interrelate aspects of (land/urban) scape resilience and models of natural risk resilience contribute to enhancing risk reduction and resilience in urban planning in high-risk situations. Achieving holistic natural risk resilience is possible when (land/urban) scape, cultural, identifying, social, spatial, planning, and economic resilience models are integrated such that they benefit from each other. Spatial planning responses to natural disasters that affect cultural and (land/urban) scape heritage and spatial resources must be planned in close interaction with local communities to improve preparedness and prevent destruction, damage, and loss of collective memory, tradition, and identity.

However, enormous time and labor has to be consumed to create these 3D models, using a 3D modeling software such as 3ds Max or SketchUp. In order to automate laborious steps, a GIS and CG integrated system is proposed for automatically generating 3D building models, based on building polygons (building footprints) on digital maps. Digital maps show most building polygons' edges meet at right angles (orthogonal polygon). In the digital map, however, not all building polygons are orthogonal. In either orthogonal or non-orthogonal polygons, the new system is proposed for automatically generating 3D building models with general shaped roofs by straight skeleton computation. In this paper, the algorithm for shrinking a polygon and forming a straight skeleton are clarified and, the new methodology is proposed for constructing roof models by assuming ` the third event' and, at the end of the shrinking process, the shrinking polygon is converged to 'a line of convergence'. In our research, extended straight skeleton computation is used for automatic generation of roof models. Based on the monotone polygons which straight skeleton computation forms, roof boards are automatically generated, and a top view of these roof boards can be a roof report for natural disaster damage.

J	Kamel, N				Kamel, Nabil			The actualization of neoliberal space and the loss of housing affordability in Santa Monica, California	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Uneven development; Gentrification; Rent control; Costa-Hawkins Act; Disaster; Northridge earthquake; Urban planning	NEW-YORK; URBAN GOVERNANCE; GENTRIFICATION; GEOGRAPHIES; POLICY; STATE; CITY; ASSISTANCE; POVERTY	This paper reveals the contingent aspect associated with the actualization of a neoliberal space. The paper examines the material, institutional, and economic conditions necessary for a neoliberal agenda to transform its urban policy objectives into a material reality. The study follows changes in housing conditions in Santa Monica, California from 1990 to 2008. During this period, the confluence of three sets of events led to the actualization of a neoliberal space. First, housing damage from the 1994 Northridge earthquake removed "dead capital" from the housing sector. Second, subsequent administrative actions at the local level and more importantly deregulation legislation at the state level eliminated rent control regulations and created market incentives that favored upscale development. Finally, the state's economic recovery generated a substantial flow of private investments into the real estate market. These combined factors led not only to the dismantling of affordable housing in Santa Monica, but also to the erosion of residents' and local authorities' ability to manage housing choices and, consequently, to a historic restructuring of Santa Monica's physical and social space. These changes had a disproportionately and negative effect on low-income and minority renters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Up-to-date monitoring on the distribution of flood hazards in cities is necessary and valuable for urban planning. This research combines two common urban flooding approaches, namely hydraulic and GIS models, in a case study of London, Ontario, Canada. The hydraulic-GIS combined model employs the hydraulic concept in a simplified GIS frame, hence avoiding heavy computation in the hydraulic model and arbitrary coefficients in a GIS model. We used a binary logistic regression model to integrate the hydraulic concept in a GIS model. The multi-criteria GIS model built by binary logistic regression was able to simulate the results from the hydraulic model with good consistency. Such a strategy serves as a promising prototype for addressing similar geographical modelling issues, where the time-consuming physical model can be potentially replaced by a simplified GIS model. Furthermore, the impervious surface percentage is an important input in the hydraulic model. This research experimented different impervious surface percentages as input to the hydraulic model and found that a spatially variable impervious surface percentage achieves better agreement with hydraulic modelling than that of uniform (25% and 42%) impervious surface percentages.

J	Bai, H; Bai, TZ; Li, W; Liu, X				Bai, Hao; Bai, Tingzhu; Li, Wei; Liu, Xun			A Building Segmentation Network Based on Improved Spatial Pyramid in Remote Sensing Images	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						CNN; semantic segmentation; super resolution; remote sensing; spatial pyramid; ResNet	SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION; FEATURE-FUSION; CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION; SUPERRESOLUTION; REGULARIZATION; MODEL; AREA	Building segmentation is widely used in urban planning, disaster prevention, human flow monitoring and environmental monitoring. However, due to the complex landscapes and highdensity settlements, automatically characterizing building in the urban village or cities using remote sensing images is very challenging. Inspired by the rencent deep learning methods, this paper proposed a novel end-to-end building segmentation network for segmenting buildings from remote sensing images. The network includes two branches: one branch uses Widely Adaptive Spatial Pyramid (WASP) structure to extract multi-scale features, and the other branch uses a deep residual network combined with a sub-pixel up-sampling structure to enhance the detail of building boundaries. We compared our proposed method with three state-of-the-art networks: DeepLabv3+, ENet, ESPNet. Experiments were performed using the publicly available Inria Aerial Image Labelling dataset (Inria aerial dataset) and the Satellite dataset II(East Asia). The results showed that our method outperformed the other networks in the experiments, with Pixel Accuracy reaching 0.8421 and 0.8738, respectively and with mIoU reaching 0.9034 and 0.8936 respectively. Compared with the basic network, it has increased by about 25% or more. It can not only extract building footprints, but also especially small building objects.

An integrated approach to the study of catastrophic debris-flows: geological hazard and human influence	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RAINFALL THRESHOLDS; SOURCE AREAS; LANDSLIDES; EXTRACTION; EVOLUTION	On 1 October 2009, a prolonged and intense rainstorm triggered hundreds of landslides (predominantly debris flows) in an area of about 50 km(2) in the north-eastern sector of Sicily (Italy). Debris flows swept the highest parts of many villages and passed over the SS114 state highway and the Messina-Catania railway, causing more than 30 fatalities. This region has a high relief, due to recent uplift. The peculiar geological and geomorphological framework represents one of the most common predisposing causes of rainstorm-triggered debris flows. This paper deals with the geological and hydro-geomorphological studies performed as a part of the post-disaster activities operated in collaboration with Civil Protection Authority, with the aim at examining landslides effects and mechanisms. The data were elaborated into a GIS platform, to evaluate the influence of urbanisation on the drainage pattern, and were correlated with the lithological and structural framework of the area. Our study points at the evaluation of the volume involved, the detection of triggering mechanisms and the precise reconstruction of the influence of urbanisation as fundamental tools for understanding the dynamics of catastrophic landslides. This kind of analysis, including all the desirable approaches for the correct management of debris flow should be the starting point for robust urban planning.

This framework employs a set of resilience indicators through a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) coupled with a Lotka-Volterra mathematical model of cooperative type. The set of indicators aims to calculate a composite index of Tern tonal Resilience (TRI), whereas the mathematical model is an extension of an existing model, aimed to predict possible long-time scenarios. The proposed operational framework for rural and vineyard landscapes aims to bridge the existing gap between territorial resilience theory and practice, with an innovative Decision Support System able to assist Decision Makers and territory planners in the planning and management of resilient territorial systems. This integrated evaluation framework is applied to a famous wine region in Portugal, the Douro Valley, where Port-wine grows. Such framework, espedally in a context of adaptive governance, proves to be a suitable support in the field of landscape and urban planning to evaluate the dynamics of sow-ecological systems and to envision long-term policies and actions.

Due to the complexity of buildings, the accurate and reliable generation of the building footprint from RS imagery is still a challenging task. In this article, an end-to-end building footprint generation approach that integrates convolution neural network (CNN) and graph model is proposed. CNN serves as the feature extractor, while the graph model can take spatial correlation into consideration. Moreover, we propose to implement the feature pairwise conditional random field (FPCRF) as a graph model to preserve sharp boundaries and fine-grained segmentation. Experiments are conducted on four different data sets: 1) Planetscope satellite imagery of the cities of Munich, Paris, Rome, and Zurich; 2) ISPRS Benchmark data from the city of Potsdam; 3) Dstl Kaggle data set; and 4) Inria Aerial Image Labeling data of Austin, Chicago, Kitsap County, Western Tyrol, and Vienna. It is found that the proposed end-to-end building footprint generation framework with the FPCRF as the graph model can further improve the accuracy of building footprint generation by using only CNN, which is the current state of the art.

J	Jha, MK; Afreen, S				Jha, Manoj K.; Afreen, Sayma			Flooding Urban Landscapes: Analysis Using Combined Hydrodynamic and Hydrologic Modeling Approaches	WATER			English	Article						flood analysis; hydrologic modeling; hydrodynamic modeling; SWAT; HEC-RAS; flood zone delineation	MISSISSIPPI RIVER-BASIN; WATER-QUALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; INUNDATION; UNCERTAINTY; SIMULATION; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION; STREAMFLOW	The frequency and severity of floods have been found to increase in recent decades, which have adverse effects on the environment, economics, and human lives. The catastrophe of such floods can be confronted with the advance prediction of floods and reliable analyses methods. This study developed a combined flood modeling system for the prediction of floods, and analysis of associated vulnerabilities on urban infrastructures. The application of the method was tested on the Blue River urban watershed in Missouri, USA, a watershed of historical significance for flood impacts and abundance of data availability for such analyses. The combined modeling system included two models: hydrodynamic model HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System) and hydrologic model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool). The SWAT model was developed for the watershed to predict time-series hydrograph data at desired locations, followed by the setup of HEC-RAS model for the analysis and prediction of flood extent. Both models were calibrated and validated independently using the observed data. The well-calibrated modeling setup was used to assess the extent of impacts of the hazard by identifying the flood risk zones and threatened critical infrastructures in flood zones through inundation mapping. Results demonstrate the usefulness of such combined modeling systems to predict the extent of flood inundation and thus support analyses of management strategies to deal with the risks associated with critical infrastructures in an urban setting. This approach will ultimately help with the integration of flood risk assessment information in the urban planning process.

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters in this issue display the different scales and fields of planning, including planning for: disaster recovery; climate change, especially opportunities for mitigation; shrinking cities in the First World; and rapidly urbanising informal and impoverished cities in the global South. At the same time, the chapters identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Olshansky and Chang highlight the increasing losses from catastrophic disasters, and address the need for disaster recovery planning. Wheeler, Randolph and London focus on climate change, and, noting the urgency of action now, their research agenda emphasises opportunities for planners to develop research and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz and Popper look at increasing economic and population trends in many First World cities that result in city 'shrinkage'. They present new opportunities for improving cities' green space networks and natural features, and for research. The trebling of urban population in African cities by 2050, in conditions of poverty and informality, is the major trend driving Parnell, Pietriese and Watson's chapter. They present an agenda for new planning theories and for supporting empirical research to address the actual conditions of African cities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This threatens the equilibrium of the socio-ecosystems where they are located and on which they depend: underground water resources are exploited with a disregard for sustainability; land is reclaimed from wetlands or lagoons; built-up areas, both formal and informal, grow without adequate urban planning. Together, all these forces can result in land surface deformation, subsidence or even uplift, which can increase risk within these already fragile socio-ecosystems. In particular, in the case of land subsidence, the risk of urban flooding can increase significantly, also considering the contribution of sea level rise driven by climate change. Monitoring such fast-changing environments is crucial to be able to identify key risks and plan adaptation responses to mitigate current and future flood risks. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool to monitor land deformation with high precision using relatively low-cost technology, also thanks to the open access data of Sentinel-1, which provides global observations every 6 days at 20-m ground resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate how it is possible to monitor land subsidence in urban coastal areas by means of permanent scatterer interferometry and Sentinel-1, exploiting an automatic procedure based on an integration of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS). We present the results of PSI analysis over the cities of Banjul (the Gambia) and Lagos (Nigeria) showing a comparison of results obtained with TerraSAR-X, Constellation of Small Satellites for the Mediterranean Basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) and Environmental Satellite advanced synthetic aperture radar (Envisat-ASAR) data. The methodology allows us to highlight areas of high land deformation, information that is useful for urban development, disaster risk management and climate adaptation planning.

Opportunities, incentives and challenges to risk sensitive land use planning: Lessons from Nepal, Spain and Vietnam	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Risk sensitive land use planning; Risk governance; Ecosystem-based approaches to disaster risk reduction; Vietnam; Spain; Nepal	DISASTER MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; CITY	This paper addresses one of the most pressing drivers of risk: land use planning and pressures placed on land use by private and public investors. Three case studies are developed, analyzing both private and public investment decisions and the interplay between regulations, acting as various incentives or disincentives. In Vietnam, dynamic urbanization is linked to political liberalization in terms of migration, private industries, land markets and urban planning. This has resulted in rapid urban growth, thereby increasing risk through urban sprawl into hazard prone areas that had previously been kept clear of urban development. In northwestern Spain, the "A Frouxeira" seashore lagoon and wetland are severely threatened by agriculture expansion, dune mining, tree plantations, tourism and the Prestige oil spill in 2002, which placed significant pressures on this fragile ecosystem, leading to social and environmental conflicts. Finally in Nepal, poor food security, landslides and changing climate conditions are pushing people out of mountainous areas to the plains and abroad, leading to illegal settlements springing up in flood-prone riverbanks. Governance is inadequate to prevent these illegal settlements but the city has now become liable for the safety of persons residing in these dangerous areas. These cases highlight how private and public investments at various levels are increasing risks and what public solutions are envisaged, if at all, to address these risks, while highlighting the difficult trade-offs between development, risk and governance. Perhaps one of the strongest arguments in favor of risk sensitive land use planning is its cost-effectiveness, considering the high costs of structural measures to reducing risk. This can include ecosystem-based approaches as part of integrated planning, an often overlooked element of DRR for mitigating hazards, reducing vulnerabilities by providing livelihood resources and even exposure when dangerous areas are converted to green belts. Finally, we conclude that more effective risk reduction is possible through improved spatial planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Assem, H; Buda, TS; O'Sullivan, D				Assem, Haytham; Buda, Teodora Sandra; O'Sullivan, Declan			RCMC: Recognizing Crowd-Mobility Patterns in Cities Based on Location Based Social Networks Data	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Crowd patterns; smart cities; urban mobility; urban computing		During the past few years, the analysis of data generated from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have aided in the identification of urban patterns, understanding activity behaviours in urban areas, as well as producing novel recommender systems that facilitate users' choices. Recognizing crowd-mobility patterns in cities is very important for public safety, traffic managment, disaster management, and urban planning. In this article, we propose a framework for Recognizing the Crowd Mobility Patterns in Cities using LBSN data. Our proposed framework comprises four main components: data gathering, recurrent crowd mobility patterns extraction, temporal functional regions detection, and visualization component. More specifically, we employ a novel approach based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation for extracting the recurrent crowd-mobility patterns in cities illustrating how crowd shifts from one area to another during each day across various time slots. Moreover, the framework employs a hierarchical clustering-based algorithm for identifying what we refer to as temporal functional regions by modeling functional areas taking into account temporal variation by means of check-ins' categories. We build the framework using a spatial-temporal dataset crawled from Twitter for two entire years (2013 and 2014) for the area of Manhattan in New York City. We perform a detailed analysis of the extracted crowd patterns with an exploratory visualization showing that our proposed approach can identify clearly obvious mobility patterns that recur over time and location in the urban scenario. Using same time interval, we show that correlating the temporal functional regions with the recognized recurrent crowd-mobility patterns can yield to a deeper understanding of city dynamics and the motivation behind the crowd mobility. We are confident that our proposed framework not only can help in managing complex city environments and better allocation of resources based on the expected crowd mobility and temporal functional regions but also can have a direct implication on a variety of applications such as personalized recommender systems, anomalous event detection, disaster resilience management systems, and others.

PIXEL-BASED APPROACH FOR BUILDING HEIGHTS DETERMINATION BY SAR RADARGRAMMETRY	CMRT13 - CITY MODELS, ROADS AND TRAFFIC 2013	ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	Joint Workshop on Object Extraction for 3D City Models, Road Databases and Traffic Monitoring - Concepts, Algorithms and Evaluation (CMRT)	NOV 12-13, 2013	Antalya, TURKEY	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing Working Grp III / 4 & III / VII		SAR radargrammetry; building height; disparity map	EXTRACTION; IMAGES	Numerous advances have been made recently in photogrammetry, laser scanning, and remote sensing for the creation of 3D city models. More and more cities are interested in getting 3D city models, be it for urban planning purposes or for supporting public utility companies. In areas often affected by natural disaster, rapid updating of the 3D information may also be useful for helping rescue forces. The high resolutions that can be achieved by the new spaceborne SAR sensor generation enables the analysis of city areas at building level and make those sensors attractive for the extraction of 3D information. Moreover, they present the advantage of weather and sunlight independency, which make them more practicable than optical data, in particular for tasks where rapid response is required. Furthermore, their short revisit time and the possibility of multi-sensor constellation enable providing several acquisitions within a few hours. This opens up the floor for new applications, especially radargrammetric applications, which consider acquisitions taken under different incidence angles. In this paper, we present a new approach for determining building heights, relying only on the radargrammetric analysis of building layover. By taking into account same-side acquisitions, we present the workflow of building height determination. Focus is set on some geometric considerations, pixel-based approach for disparity map calculation, and analysis of the building layover signature for different configurations in order to determine building height.

J	Lara, A; del Moral, L				Lara, Angela; del Moral, Leandro			Nature-Based Solutions to Hydro-Climatic Risks: Barriers and Triggers for Their Implementation in Seville (Spain)	LAND			English	Article						nature-based solutions; barriers and triggers; urban green infrastructure; climate change adaptation	GRASS-ROOTS INNOVATIONS; SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WATER MANAGEMENT; PATH DEPENDENCE; URBAN; VULNERABILITY; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; POLICY	Nature-based solutions (NbS) are currently a priority of international institutions (UN and EU) to improve urban resilience to hydro-climatic risks. However, responsible institutions, such as river basin authorities and local governments, while still prioritizing gray infrastructure, often present resistance to these strategies. This paper analyzes this issue in the case of Seville (Spain). We identify historical and recent institutional practices related to the development of gray infrastructure and the experience of citizens' movements that demand the implementation of green infrastructure and the naturalization of urban space. Based on the theoretical framework of the sustainability transition, the article contributes to the identification of the factors that hinder or trigger the processes of change, drawing from the results of a case with a long tradition in hydro-climatic disaster management. The research has included an in-depth review of risk planning in the city of Seville, semi-structured interviews with 24 social and institutional actors, and participant observation of both urban planning processes and the practices of citizen movements. Our results show that the generation of shared visions clashes, first with conflicting perceptions of the city's strengths and weaknesses regarding risks; second, with contradictions between institutional discourses and practices, and finally, with the operational limitations of public participation processes.

Extracting spatial patterns of urban gas pipeline risk considering social and structural parameters of urban blocks	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Risk assessment; Vulnerability; Urban gas pipelines; Geospatial information system (GIS); Hazard map	NATURAL-GAS; MAJOR HAZARDS; VULNERABILITY; NETWORK; MODEL	Due to growing cities and urbanization, the demand for natural gas is increasing rapidly around the world. To address this necessity, the density of urban natural gas pipelines will increase. However, urban pipelines pass through regions with the high density of people and buildings with low construction quality, possibly leading to accidents that may cause extreme damage to people and property. In this paper, a quantitative method is proposed for evaluation of hazards that are influenced by the inherent parameters of gas pipelines considering their density. Afterwards, considering the physical and social vulnerabilities of this study area, the structural and social parameters of urban blocks are added to the risk model. The output of this method is used to analyze the risk of spatial patterns of urban natural gas pipelines and the structural and social parameters of urban blocks. This research model consists of the following three main sections: hazard mapping of urban gas pipelines considering their inherent parameters, physical and social vulnerability mapping of urban blocks, and risk mapping of gas pipelines. The results show that there are meaningful spatial patterns in risk distributions that can be analyzed by the vulnerability results. The output of the proposed method has many applications in the fields of disaster management, urban planning and incident prediction.

UVid-Net: Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of UAV Aerial Videos by Embedding Temporal Information	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Videos; Semantics; Image segmentation; Feature extraction; Optical imaging; Computer architecture; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Deep learning; semantic segmentation; transfer learning; U-Net; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video		Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management. The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN-based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation. In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labeling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature-refiner module, which aids in accurate localization of the class labels. The proposed UVid-Net architecture for UAV video semantic segmentation is quantitatively evaluated on extended ManipalUAVid dataset. The performance metric mean Intersection over Union of 0.79 has been observed which is significantly greater than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the proposed work produced promising results even for the pretrained model of UVid-Net on urban street scene by fine tuning the final layer on UAV aerial videos.

J	Lwin, KK; Sekimoto, Y; Takeuchi, W				Lwin, Ko Ko; Sekimoto, Yoshihide; Takeuchi, Wataru			Estimation of Hourly Link Population and Flow Directions from Mobile CDR	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						big data; CDR origin-destination pairs; shortest-path analysis; hourly link population and flow direction; home-based magnification factor (h-MF)		The rise in big data applications in urban planning and transport management is now widening and becoming a part of local government decision-making processes. Understanding people flow inside the city helps urban and transport planners build a healthy and lively city. Many flow maps are based on origin-and-destination points with crossing lines, which reduce the map's readability and overall appearance. Today, with the emergence of geolocation-enabled handheld devices with wireless communication and networking capabilities, human mobility and the resulting events can be captured and stored as text-based geospatial big data. In this paper, we used one-week mobile-call-detail records (CDR) and a GIS road network model to estimate hourly link population and flow directions, based on mobile-call activities of origin-destination pairs with a shortest-path analysis for the whole city. Moreover, to gain the actual population size from the number of mobile-call users, we introduced a home-based magnification factor (h-MF) by integrating with the national census. Therefore, the final output link data have both magnitude (actual population) and flow direction at one-hour intervals between 06:00 and 21:00.

Under a contract initiated in February 2000, Synergy partnered with a number of universities and State and Local government agencies in the United States to develop a variety of remote sensing applications. Phase I of Synergy focused on exploring the potential use of satellite imagery for disaster management, urban planning, water resource management, precision agriculture, and natural resources management and protection. The objectives were to demonstrate the practical use of EOS data in real world applications. For State and Local Government applications, the intent was to enhance the ability of end users at different governmental levels to make viable managerial decisions and formulate sound planning policies. The program focused on making data, extracted information, derived products, and prototype applications more readily accessible for end users through web-based "Infomarts". These Infomarts would provide data browsing and downloading capabilities as well as interactive mapping tools. The Infomarts were geared primarily toward governmental organizations that have the potential to utilize remote sensing data and integrate extracted information and derived products in geographic information systems (GIS). Key to the success of Synergy was the early and continued involvement of end users throughout the development and implementation cycle. Analysis of the requirements defined by end users facilitated identification of value-added products and aided in developing promising prototype applications.

Geographical data have proven its importance in several domains. For instance, the formation and scrutiny of climate networks have emerged as a new research topic in environmental literature. However, there is still a lack of investigations of scenarios with very high spatial resolution, such as those considering meteorological data. Recently, a new concept, named (geo)graphs, was proposed. (Geo)graphs are graphs, or networks, in which the nodes have an assigned geographical location. Besides embedding nodes into space, these graphs are readily manipulated with a geographical information system, and, thus, represent a suitable tool for dealing with very high-resolution scenarios, such as meteorological data. In this context, here, we apply a (geo)graph approach to model a radar-derived rainfall data set. We represent the nodes as a point-type shapefile and the edges as a line-type shapefile, which are standard file types in geoinformatics. After, we analyze the topological properties of a family of (geo)graphs considering distinct thresholds. The analysis of these networks reveals a spatially well-defined community structure, which, interestingly, is consistent with topographical/altimetric and land use/land cover data. These results show the relation between geographical properties and the topological structure of the network might be applied to different ecological studies, from sustainable development to urban planning and disaster risk reduction.

J	Usamah, M; Handmer, J; Mitchell, D; Ahmed, I				Usamah, Muhibuddin; Handmer, John; Mitchell, David; Ahmed, Iftekhar			Can the vulnerable be resilient? Co-existence of vulnerability and disaster resilience: Informal settlements in the Philippines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Vulnerability; Resilience; Informal settlements; Philippines	COMMUNITY RESILIENCE	This paper explores the relationship between vulnerability and resilience in the context of informal settlements, using a case study of two barangays in a rural province in the Philippines. Central to the discussion in this paper is whether and how vulnerability and resilience can exist simultaneously. The authors first identify community vulnerability, which is explored through geographical, economic, and physical vulnerability. Another element involves land-related vulnerability characterised by unsustainable land use, poor urban planning, nonexistence of building codes and weak land administration. Approximately sixty per cent of all properties in the case study areas are held in informal land tenures. Many of these informal settlers have established houses on land with a high hazard risk - for example, adjacent to rivers, on disused railway reserves and along road corridors. The result is they face the threat of eviction, and may have difficulty returning to their land after disasters. Qualitative analysis of households in the case study areas revealed that the strength of social relationships helps to reduce the vulnerability of the communities. A paradoxical relationship between vulnerability and resilience is evident. Strong community perceptions of their level of resilience to the impacts of disasters are supported by the social domains of the community. They have inbuilt resilience resulting from the perception of disasters as part of life, strong social bonds and government awareness of the validity of the informal settlements.

However, the factors contributing to its disparate racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic effects are part of an expansive and continuous history of oppressive social policy and marginalising geopolitics. This history is characterised by institutionally generated spatial inequalities forged through processes of residential segregation and neglectful urban planning. In the USA, aspects of COVID-19's manifestation closely mirror elements of the build-up and response to the Flint crisis, Michigan's racially and class-contoured water crisis that began in 2014, and to other prominent environmental injustice cases, such as the 1995 Chicago (IL, USA) heatwave that severely affected the city's south and west sides, predominantly inhabited by Black people. Each case shares common macrosocial and spatial characteristics and is instructive in showing how civic trust suffers in the aftermath of public health disasters, becoming especially degenerative among historically and spatially marginalised populations. Offering a commentary on the sociogeographical dynamics that gave rise to these crises and this institutional distrust, we discuss how COVID-19 has both inherited and augmented patterns of spatial inequality. We conclude by outlining particular steps that can be taken to prevent and reduce spatial inequalities generated by COVID-19, and by discussing the preliminary steps to restore trust between historically disenfranchised communities and the public officials and institutions tasked with responding to COVID-19.

One of the most affected areas is building and urban utilities. After earthquake, human beings living place come across different degrees of damages. Sometimes, people encounter with problems in providing their basic needs including shelter, etc. After earthquake, one of the basic needs of crisis management in every city is to have open spaces for emergency accommodation of wounded people. So, one aspect of urban planning is designing and providing infrastructure facilities at the time of crisis. Infrastructure facilities include relief centers, predictions of open spaces for emergency accommodation, emergency roads, etc. Non- suitable performance of each member, the existing shortages in this regard, and non - suitable distribution of these facilities based on the population density at the time of after - earthquake encounter crisis management with problem. This research attempts to find the existing shortcomings by studying and identifying. The existing open spaces in the district one and district two of Zanjan city (Iran) for emergency accommodation of people after earthquake and adopting it to the population density of these areas. Arc - GIS and Auto - cad software's are used to design a map in this research. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the diversity of geometric shapes and the blurring of boundaries among buildings, it is still a challenging task to accurately generate building footprints from the complex scenes of remote sensing images. The rapid development of convolutional neural networks is presenting both new opportunities and challenges with respect to the extraction of buildings from high-resolution remote sensing images. To capture multilevel contextual information, most deep learning methods extract buildings by integrating multilevel features. However, the differential responses between such multilevel features are often ignored, leading to blurred contours in the extraction results. In this study, we propose an end-to-end multitask building extraction method to address these issues; this approach utilizes the rich contextual features of remote sensing images to assist with building segmentation while ensuring that the shape of the extraction results is preserved. By combining boundary classification and boundary distance regression, clear contour and distance transformation maps are generated to further improve the accuracy of building extraction. Subsequently, multiple refinement modules are used to refine each part of the network to minimize the loss of image feature information. Experimental comparisons conducted on the SpaceNet and Massachusetts building datasets show that the proposed method outperforms other deep learning methods in terms of building extraction results.

J	Liu, CL; Li, Y				Liu, Chunlu; Li, Yan			GIS-based dynamic modelling and analysis of flash floods considering land-use planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Land use; GIS; flash flood; infrastructure construction; modelling	SCS-CN METHOD; URBAN; RUNOFF; IMPACT; AREA; RISK	Flood inundation is a common natural disaster and a growing development challenge for many cities and thousands of small towns around the world. Soil features have frequently altered with the rapid development of urbanised regions, which has led to more frequent and longer duration of flooding in urban flood-prone regions. Thus, this paper presents a geographic information system (GIS)-based methodology for measuring and visualising the effects on urban flash floods generated by land-use changes over time. The measurement is formulated with a time series in order to perform a dynamic analysis. A catchment mesh is introduced into a hydrological model for reflecting the spatial layouts of infrastructure and structures over different construction periods. The Geelong Waurn Ponds campus of Deakin University is then selected as a case study. Based on GIS simulation and mapping technologies, this research illustrates the evolutionary process of flash floods. The paper then describes flood inundation for different built environments and presents a comparison by quantifying the flooding extents for infrastructure and structures. The results reveal that the GIS-based estimation model can examine urban flash floods in different development phases and identify the change of flooding extents in terms of land-use planning. This study will bring benefits to urban planners in raising awareness of flood impact and the approach proposed here could be used for flood mitigation through future urban planning.

Lynn			UAV-Based Stereo Vision for Rapid Aerial Terrain Mapping	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING			English	Article								Aerial terrain mapping has been used for many years to monitor natural habitats and ecosystems, assist in urban planning, and monitor trends in land usage. Recent improvements in digital imaging, LiDAR, and synthetic aperture radar have facilitated the generation of 3-D terrain models for analysis in these applications. Unfortunately, these systems typically require large manned aircraft and significant post-processing of data before viewable results are produced. This inhibits use of these technologies in time-critical applications such as disaster relief, autonomous obstacle avoidance, and landing-zone assessment for a vertical take-off and landing aircraft. This paper describes a wide-baseline stereo vision system that enables near-real-time generation of dense 3-D terrain maps. The key advantage of computational stereo vision over monocular structure-from-motion is that terrain can be reconstructed from a single synchronized pair of calibrated images. The paper describes a working prototype, and presents a novel approach for combining separate stereo maps into larger terrain mosaics. The new stereo system and algorithm have an accuracy ranging from 56 cm to 65 cm across the field of view at an altitude of 40 m. Also, dense correlation of the imagery generates over 2200 points/m(2). The system weighs just 3.1 kg, roughly one-fourth the weight of comparable high-altitude mapping systems, at ca. one-tenth the cost. The paper also describes potential implementations using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for real-time operation.

Such trend has urged the importance of urban prevention schemes. In this study, risk against urban flood damage in case of local downpour in highly concentrated urban areas is classified based on each use district to effectively cope with such disaster events. For city of Changwon, Korea, risk against economic and social damage of urban flood is classified for each use district by applying a fuzzy model using relevant district data that provide institutional bases of land use, data of land price and land areas that estimate the property values, data of underground space that is expected to have the greatest flood damage, and the data of model year of buildings that influence the vulnerability to flood damage. Analysis result for the districts of Changwon city shows that the highest flood damage was in central commercial areas, followed by general commercial, semiresidential, distribution commercial, neighborhood commercial, private residential, general residential, industrial, and green areas, because commercial areas have the highest density of buildings and the highest land values per unit area. This study has a unique research value because not only could it be used as data designing future land-use and urban planning, but also it proposed a mitigation plan against urban flood under climate change by variating land uses.

Numerous initiatives aim at incorporating resilience into urban planning practices. The purpose of this paper is to open up a conversation on urban resilience by unpacking how diverse science methods contribute to the production of different narratives of urban resilience mobilizing different experts and forms of evidence. A number of scholars have cautioned against uncritical approaches to resilience and asked what resilience means and for whom, also pointing out the normative dimension of the concept. Building on this emerging scholarship we use insights from science and technology studies (STS) and critical social sciences to look at the knowledge infrastructures and networks of actors involved in the development of resilience strategies. Drawing on fieldwork in Manila, Nairobi, and Cape Town, we map different narratives of urban resilience identifying the ways in which science serves to legitimate or alienate particular perspectives on what should be done. We discuss the multiple roles that science methods have for resilience planning. Whereas urban resilience is often portrayed as consensual, we show that a range of narratives, with diverse socio-material implications, exist at the city level. In this way we unearth the conflict that lies beneath an apparent consensus for resilience policy and outline future research directions for urban sustainability.

J	Nativi, S				Nativi, Stefano			The implementation of international geospatial standards for earth and space sciences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH			English	Article						digital earth infrastructures; System of Systems; multi-disciplinary interoperability; interoperability standards; information modelling approach	INTEROPERABILITY	The Earth and Space Sciences Informatics division of European Geosciences Union (EGU) and the Open Geospatial Consortium jointly organised a special event entitled: 'Implementation of international geospatial standards for earth and space sciences event' - at the EGU General Assembly meeting held in Vienna, April 2009. The event objectives included: (a) to discuss the integration of information systems from different geosciences disciplines; (b) to promote and discuss the present process to scale from specific and monolithic systems towards independent and modular enabling infrastructures - forming an earth system science (ESS) infrastructure; and (c) to show some of the latest advances in implementing open standards. This manuscript introduces the event motivations and describes the abstract and holistic framework, which can be used to situate the topics and the developments presented by the event speakers. This manuscript introduces important, and relatively new technologies to build a multi-disciplinary geosciences information system: the System of Systems approach and the Model Driven Approach. To achieve that, three important information infrastructure categories are recognised: (a) ESS information infrastructure; (b) geospatial information infrastructure; and (c) distributed information infrastructure. Digital Earth should support the discussed framework to accelerate information transfer from theoretical discussions to applications, in all fields related to global climate change, natural disaster prevention and response, new energy-source development, agricultural and food security, and urban planning and management.

J	Baum, F				Baum, Fran			How can health promotion contribute to pulling humans back from the brink of disaster?	GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						Climate change; determinants of health; empowerment; power; equity; social justice; health promotion; policy; politics; urban planning; urban health; urbanisation	PEOPLES; DETERMINANTS	Health promotion has evolved over the last decades from a primary focus on behaviour change to establishing an ambitious goal of creating healthy, fair and sustainable environments in a manner which realises the rights of all people to health and well-being while protecting the health of our planet and its ecosystems. This paper argues that in order to contribute to this ambitious goal, health promotion must address three key tasks. The first is the need to take planetary health more seriously and move away from reductionist thinking to an approach that sees the planet as a complex system and values more harmony with nature, protects biodiversity and prevents global warming. The second task is to advocate and support governments to govern for health. The key to doing this is putting health and equity before profit, creating healthy urban environments, encouraging participatory decision-making, advocating for healthy economic models and assessing the ways in which corporate determinants of health operate. The third task is to ensure that moves to professionalise health promotion do not come at the expense of health promotion advocacy to powerful people and organisations. Health promotion is well placed to support civil society movements arguing for social and economic change that will benefit health such as the Black Lives Matter and environment movements.

The aim of the present study is to introduce a framework for the identification of flood-prone areas using geographical information systems techniques and decision-making, based on a comparative evaluation for various scenarios. As a case study, the Attica region in Greece is selected, which is occasionally affected by heavy rainfall, the main cause of flooding in the region, coupled with the fact that human activities and urbanization of recent years play a significant role in flood occurrence. In this context, the development and application of a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis method for the determination of areas susceptible to flood events is initially presented. The entire spatial analysis is performed using SAGA 6.3.0 and ArcMap 10.2 Desktop, by applying a number of alternative modifications and, finally, by evaluating different scenarios regarding methods for the criteria standardization, criteria hierarchy and factors' weighting estimation. The proposed framework has an advantage among other approaches, since it takes into account mainly static data that are linked to flooding, such as the topography and land cover distribution and it can be easily customized in ungauged catchments.

However, as various different of approaches to estimate the current distribution of population and dwellings exists, further evidence on past dynamics is needed for a better understanding of urban processes. This article therefore addresses the question of whether and how accurately historical distributions of dwellings and inhabitants can be reconstructed with commonly available geodata from national mapping and cadastral agencies. For this purpose, an approach for the automatic derivation of such information is presented. The data basis is constituted by a current digital landscape model and a 3D building model combined with historical land use information automatically extracted from historical topographic maps. For this purpose, methods of image processing, machine learning, change detection and dasymetric mapping are applied. The results for a study area in Germany show that it is possible to automatically derive decadal historical patterns of population and dwellings from 1950 to 2011 at the level of a 100 m grid with slight underestimations and acceptable standard deviations. By a differentiated analysis we were able to quantify the errors for different urban structure types.

However, the high density and slight boundary differences of urban building regions pose a great challenge for accurate building extraction. Although existing building extraction methods have achieved better results in urban building extraction, there are still some problems, such as boundary information loss, poor extraction effect for dense regions, and serious interference by building shadows. To accurately extract building regions from high-resolution remote sensing images, in this study, we propose a practical method for building extraction based on convolution neural networks (CNNs). Firstly, the multi-scale recurrent residual convolution is introduced into the generative network to extract the multi-scale and multi-resolution features of remote sensing images. Secondly, the attention gates skip connection (AGs) is used to enhance the information interaction between different scale features. Finally, the adversarial network with parallel architecture is used to decrease the difference between the extracted results and the ground truths. Moreover, the conditional information constraint is introduced in the training process to improve robustness and generalization ability of the proposed method. The qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed on IAILD and Massachusetts datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately and effectively extract building regions from remote sensing images.

M.; Udayraj			Integration of Texture and Spectral Response with AI Techniques for Buildings Footprint Identification Using High-Resolution Satellite Images	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Visual geometry group; Conventional neural network; High-resolution satellite data; Remote sensing and GIS		The rapid growth and advancement in the application of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) in several application domains helped many researchers to analyze a wide range of information from satellite imagery. Settlement information that includes building foot prints is a very essential parameter for different applications such as urban planning, environmental planning and disaster management. VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group) conventional neural network (CNN) model is a popular model used to detect and classify the input images. In this study, a new approach was proposed by integration of VGG-16-CNN model with spectral and textural information of satellite images for identification of building foot prints. The model was trained and implemented to identify the building footprints using Worldview-3 high-resolution satellite image over part of Mumbai city of Maharashtra state, India. Classification accuracy in the proposed approach is observed to be nearly 94% as compared to 82% in case of single-shot detector (SSD) algorithm alone. Metric parameters such as F1 score of 0.957, intersection over union (IoU) of 94.86% and total error rate of 8.133% also indicated better performance of the proposed approach. Particularly, the approach is highly beneficial for urban development authorities as they need to monitor the large number of vacant lands spread across urban areas.

Multicommodity flows and Benders decomposition for restricted continuous location problems	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Location; Mathematical modeling; Network design; Multicommodity network flow; Benders decomposition	FACILITY LOCATION; FORBIDDEN REGIONS; ALGORITHMS; BARRIERS; MODEL	The restricted continuous facility location problem arises when there is a need to locate a number of facilities to serve a discrete set of demand points, and where the location of a facility can be anywhere on the plane except for in restricted regions. The problem finds applications in urban planning, disaster management, and healthcare logistics. The restricted regions can occur randomly or are known in advance. The paper describes a new model for the problem that is based on multicommodity flows with unknown destinations and defined on a discretization of the plane. The model and discretization are applied to both the deterministic and the stochastic continuous restricted location problem, where the latter is converted into a deterministic equivalent problem by minimizing the expected value of the objective function weighted by the probabilities of scenarios. The paper also describes a Benders decomposition algorithm to optimally solve the model. Extensive computational results are presented on both benchmark instances from the literature and new instances, on both the deterministic and stochastic variant of the problem. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to an off-the-shelf solver in terms of computational time.

J	Das, P; Chand, S				Das, Prativa; Chand, Satish			Extracting Building Footprints from High-resolution Aerial Imagery Using Refined Cross AttentionNet	IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						Aerial imagery; attention mechanism; binary segmentation; building footprints extraction; deep learning; FCN; feature fusion		Automatic building extraction has significant socio-economic applications such as population estimation, urban planning, rapid disaster response, monitoring illegal land acquisition, and change detection. The traditional methods fail to deal with the challenges entirely associated with building extraction, i.e. different shape, size, texture of buildings, missing and incomplete buildings due to the occlusion, and high intra-class variation. The existing CNN-based approaches are incapable of recovering the boundary information, especially when the building structures are small and complex. To alleviate the issues faced by current methods, we propose a lightweight attention mechanism-based model - refined cross attention neural network (RCA-Net) for precisely extracting the coarse-to-fine building features. Unlike recent attention mechanism-based approaches, the RCA-Net utilizes spatial and channel attention to capture the long-range multi-scale context. Then, we introduce an efficient attention module, the Global Attention Fuse (GAF) module, that fuses the local and global cross-channel relationships to capture the essential features without enhancing the computational complexity. A loss function, unified loss, is also presented that combines BCE loss and dice loss to alleviate the imbalanced class distribution problem. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the latest method DSNet by 2.06% and 1.47% in IoU and 2.11% and 1.27% in F1-score on the publicly available datasets: Massachusetts building dataset and Inria Aerial Image Labeling dataset, respectively.

J	Mensah, H; Ahadzie, DK				Mensah, Henry; Ahadzie, Divine Kwaku			Causes, impacts and coping strategies of floods in Ghana: a systematic review	SN APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Review						Climate change; Causes; Coping strategy; Effects/impacts; Floods; Ghana	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN-POOR; RISK; ACCRA; KUMASI; INFRASTRUCTURE; COMMUNITIES; REDUCTION; DISASTER	Urban flooding has become a major problem in many parts of the world due to its social, economic and environmental impact. In Ghana, flood occurs every year, which adversely affects livelihoods, property, infrastructure, lives and renders many people homeless. In this paper, we aim to understand the current state of flood research in Ghana, focusing on how the scholarly community has approached the causes, effects/impact, and the coping strategies adopted by people in the urban setting. Drawing on a comprehensive literature review, combined with individual co-author in-depth experience in research and practice in Ghana, we searched academic database such as SCOPUS, Web of Science, Springer, Taylor and Francis, Science Direct and Google scholar for recent studies. Our results, on the basis of 33 articles, indicate that poor urban planning and development (number of reported articles, n = 18), poor and inadequate drainage facilities (n = 11), poor environmental attitude (n = 10) and extreme rainfall (n = 8) are the top causes of urban flood in Ghana. The most commonly reported impacts/effects were physical cost (n = 7), destruction of economic infrastructure (n = 5) and health concerns (n = 4). The most reported coping strategies were relocation and protection of properties ( n = 9) and construction of drains (n = 8). The review also pointed out critical research gaps in the context of Ghana and suggested a new area for future research direction and practice.

In order to fulfill the financial dimension of this urban regeneration attempt, the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization has developed a planning standard called "Sustainably Performed Urban Regeneration" SuPerUrban to mobilize the economies of sustainable living styles. Compared with the classical urban planning approaches, the environment friendly planning and urban design standard has focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the redevelopment and to create a new urban lifestyle in terms of the use of land, energy, water, natural resources and transportation. SuPerUrban reduces living costs of the households and local government expenditures and provide efficiencies that can be measured with the reduced percentage of the overall carbon footprint. Eventually, while being urban friendly it provides the means for the households to finance their share of the cost of regeneration with their reduced daily expenditures. In order to facilitate the model, carbon footprint calculation tool is developed to assist the project owners at both the neighborhood and building levels. Certain technology alternatives are provided to choose and compare the savings and reductions easily from the web. A pilot project is also developed using the standard and the tool in Eskisehir, Turkey. The technologies to be used in the project are intended to be produced in the area in order to provide jobs and create a green economy.

J	Hu, YJ; Mao, HN; McKenzie, G				Hu, Yingjie; Mao, Huina; McKenzie, Grant			A natural language processing and geospatial clustering framework for harvesting local place names from geotagged housing advertisements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Local place name; gazetteer; natural language processing; named entity recognition; geospatial clustering; geospatial semantics	PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION GIS; GAZETTEER; GENERATION; KNOWLEDGE	Local place names are frequently used by residents living in a geographic region. Such place names may not be recorded in existing gazetteers, due to their vernacular nature, relative insignificance to a gazetteer covering a large area (e.g. the entire world), recent establishment (e.g. the name of a newly-opened shopping center) or other reasons. While not always recorded, local place names play important roles in many applications, from supporting public participation in urban planning to locating victims in disaster response. In this paper, we propose a computational framework for harvesting local place names from geotagged housing advertisements. We make use of those advertisements posted on local-oriented websites, such as Craigslist, where local place names are often mentioned. The proposed framework consists of two stages: natural language processing (NLP) and geospatial clustering. The NLP stage examines the textual content of housing advertisements and extracts place name candidates. The geospatial stage focuses on the coordinates associated with the extracted place name candidates and performs multiscale geospatial clustering to filter out the non-place names. We evaluate our framework by comparing its performance with those of six baselines. We also compare our result with four existing gazetteers to demonstrate the not-yet-recorded local place names discovered by our framework.

Change detection of linear features in temporally spaced remotely sensed images using edge-based grid analysis	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Change detection; remote sensing; high resolution; land cover; edge detection; power spectral density	RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY; LAND-COVER; SEGMENTATION; METHODOLOGY; ALGORITHMS; AREA	Automatic change detection of land cover features using high-resolution satellite images, is a challenging problem in the field of intelligent remote sensing data interpretation, and is becoming more and more effective for its applications viz. urban planning and monitoring, disaster assessment etc. In the present study, a change in detection approach based on the image morphology that analyses change in the local image grids is proposed. In this approach, edges from both the images are extracted and grid wise comparison is made by probabilistic thresholding and power spectral density analysis for identifying change area. One of the advantages of the proposed methodology is that the temporal images used in the change analysis need not be radiometrically corrected as analysis is based on edge extractions. The grid-based analysis further reduces the error, which might have been introduced by image mis-registration. The proposed methodology is validated by finding the temporal changes in the linear land cover features in parts of Kolkata city, India using three different image data-sets from LISS IV, Cartosat-1 and Google earth having varied spatial resolutions of 5.8m, 2.5m and about 1m, respectively.

J	Rodrigues, MR				Rodrigues, Maria Rita			FROM RESPONSE TO PREVENTION: INTERFACES BETWEEN DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT AND URBAN PLANNING	GEO UERJ			Portuguese	Article						Urban politic; Disasters risk management; Cities resiliency		In the recent decades, disasters have become an even more often present subject in the everyday life of populations from several regions, demonstrating a significant increase not just in terms of frequency and intensity, but also showing the huge damage caused by their impacts. In the national context the disasters risk management, historically, prioritized the action of response, so that even the legislative process or the public policies presented typically responsive characteristics, which added to the fact that the matter in question was equally disregarded by the urban agenda, then been added to the vulnerability of the Brazilian cities to the socioenvironmental catastrophes. However, some events with catastrophic aspects which have succeeded each other in the transition from the first to the second decade of the XXI century were as a sort of systemic irritation, once they have raised a political reply which came out with the approval of the Federal Law n 12.608/2012. The referred legislation in connection with the City Statute conform the urban right means to the principles of protection and prevention, so that the land use ordination and control should avoid the exposure of the population to disasters risk. As subjective as it may be, to the legislative advance and the new urban politics reorientation, some challenges establish themselves. The discontinuity of the urban public policies and the budget cuts are setbacks that need to be confronted so that the cities resiliency can be really achieved.

J	Uchowicz, K				Uchowicz, Katarzyna			[OVER]WRITE MODERNISM. THE LETTERS BY SYRKUS TO GROPIUS	SZTUKA I DOKUMENTACJA-ART & DOCUMENTATION			Polish	Article								The article reveals a little-known aspect of an international architectural milieu, the correspondence network animated by women and their typing machines. Helena, born Eliasberg, together with her husband and professional partner Szymon Syrkus, were key figures in the history of the Polish Avant-garde; founders of a prominent modernists group and the journal Praesens. Nevertheless, Helena Syrkus, secretary and vice-chairwomen of CIAM (Congres international d'architecture moderne), was carrying out the correspondence on behalf of her husband and herself. There exists a lot of letters exchanged between Polish architects and the famous "Bauhaus-couple" - Walter and Ise Gropius, as well as the Dutch architect Cornelis van Eesteren and his wife Frieda Fluck. In fact, letters from Walter, who was a Bauhaus leader were also typed by Ise Gropius on her typing machine (equipped with small lamp designed by Marianne Brandt from the Bauhaus group). Apparently, correspondence is an uncommon research field for architectural historians, but seems to be important phenomenon; these letters are a fertile source for the history of modern movements, including issues like minimal dwellings, functional cities, social settlement, urban planning. We can better understand unexpected twists in individual biographies, coherently related to the antisemitism of the late 1930s; the disaster of World War II, and the delusions of socialism. Regardless of the demise of their husbands, Helena Syrkus and Ise Gropius continued their correspondence for many years ("Use a typing machine and describe me everything" - wrote Gropius to Syrkus in one of her late letters). Additionally, the article depicts means such as photographs and typed texts used as promotional tools of Bauhaus ideas. Moreover, the typing machine itself became a substantial challenge for Bauhaus designers (in fact, Gropius designed a typing machine for the Adler Company). This appliance was also regarded as an attribute of a modern woman (like the automobile for a modern man). The ability to use new stenotyping and stenography techniques, and expertise in four languages allowed Helena Syrkus to be financially independent and - finally - one of the most significant women in international architectural society of the twentieth century. The article "(Over)write modernism. The Letters by Syrkus - Gropius" relates to the publication: CIAM Archipelago. Letters of Helena Syrkus, which presents a selection of personal letters in Polish and English language. This book, edited by Aleksandra Kedziorek, Katarzyna Uchowicz and Maja Wirkus has been published by the Polish National Institute of Architecture and Urban Planning (Narodowy Instytut Architektury i Urbanistyki) in 2019. The article provides a short introduction to this book.

J	Asgary, A; Ozdemir, AI; Ozyurek, H				Asgary, Ali; Ozdemir, Ali Ihsan; Ozyurek, Hale			Small and Medium Enterprises and Global Risks: Evidence from Manufacturing SMEs in Turkey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						Global risks; Risk assessment; Risk matrix; Small and medium enterprises; Turkey	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; TERRORISM; BUSINESS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PREPAREDNESS; STRATEGIES; DEMAND; SECTOR; IMPACT	This study investigated how small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in a country perceive major global risks. The aim was to explore how country attributes and circumstances affect SME assessments of the likelihood, impacts, and rankings of global risks, and to find out if SME risk assessment and rankings differ from the global rankings. Data were gathered using an online survey of manufacturing SMEs in Turkey. The results show that global economic risks and geopolitical risks are of major concern for SMEs, and environmental risks are at the bottom of their ranking. Among the economic risks, fiscal crises in key economies and high structural unemployment or underemployment were found to be the highest risks for the SMEs. Failure of regional or global governance, failure of national governance, and interstate conflict with regional consequences were found to be among the top geopolitical risks for the SMEs. The SMEs considered the risk of large-scale cyber-attacks and massive incident of data fraud/theft to be relatively higher than other global technological risks. Profound social instability and failure of urban planning were among the top societal risks for the SMEs. Although the global environmental and disaster risks were ranked lowest on the list, man-made environmental damage and disasters and major natural hazard-induced disasters were ranked the highest among this group of risks. Overall, the results show that SMEs at a country level, for example Turkey, perceive global risks differently than the major global players.

Object-Based Convolutional Neural Network for High-Resolution Imagery Classification	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; high-resolution image; image classification	SCENE CLASSIFICATION; DEEP; MULTISCALE; FEATURES	Timely and accurate classification and interpretation of high-resolution images are very important for urban planning and disaster rescue. However, as spatial resolution gets finer, it is increasingly difficult to recognize complex patterns in high-resolution remote sensing images. Deep learning offers an efficient strategy to fill the gap between complex image patterns and their semantic labels. However, due to the hierarchical abstract nature of deep learning methods, it is difficult to capture the precise outline of different objects at the pixel level. To further reduce this problem, we propose an object-based deep learning method to accurately classify the high-resolution imagery without intensive human involvement. In this study, high-resolution images were used to accurately classify three different urban scenes: Beijing (China), Pavia (Italy), and Vaihingen (Germany). The proposed method is built on a combination of a deep feature learning strategy and an object-based classification for the interpretation of high-resolution images. Specifically, high-level feature representations extracted through the convolutional neural networks framework have been systematically investigated over five different layer configurations. Furthermore, to improve the classification accuracy, an object-based classification method also has been integrated with the deep learning strategy for more efficient image classification. Experimental results indicate that with the combination of deep learning and object-based classification, it is possible to discriminate different building types in Beijing Scene, such as commercial buildings and residential buildings with classification accuracies above 90%.

J	Guillier, F				Guillier, Flora			French Insurance and Flood Risk: Assessing the Impact of Prevention Through the Rating of Action Programs for Flood Prevention	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						Action programs for flood prevention (PAPI); Collective flood prevention; Flood disaster insurance; Flood vulnerability assessment; France		French insurance is part of a public-private partnership with the French State to compensate flood-related damages, and there is growing concern among insurers about damaging climatic events. To promote preventive actions as well as to take them into account in flood risk assessment, insurers have recently expressed the need to develop a rating system of preventive actions. This study identified Action Programs for Flood Prevention (Programme d'Action pour la Pr,vention des Inondations-PAPI) as the key French public policy instrument: they provide an overview of the diversity of actions that are conducted locally at the relevant risk basin scale. A database of all intended actions in the 145 launched PAPIs was constructed and the actions were coded (88 codes). The analysis consisted of two steps: (1) We conducted an expert valuation using the Analytic Network Process and the Analytic Hierarchy Process, aiming at creating an experimental national rating system. The results show the importance of implementing an integrated strategy that particularly emphasizes land use planning and urban planning. This appears even sounder as individual actions show relatively limited effectiveness. (2) The ratings of actions were applied to each PAPI according to their implemented actions. The resulting scores for individual PAPIs, as local risk coping capacity indicators, show great variance ranging from 8 to 324 points. This confirms the need to take prevention into account in flood risk assessment.

With the continuing effects of climate change, these two issues will become more acute and will add to the serious problems already experienced in dense urban areas. Therefore, the sectors of public health and disaster management are in the need of tools that can assess the vulnerability to floods and thermal stress. The present paper deals with the combination of innovative tools to address this challenge. Three cities in different climatic regions with various urban contexts have been selected as the pilot areas to demonstrate these tools. These cities are Tainan (Taiwan), Ayutthaya (Thailand) and Groningen (Netherlands). For these cities, flood maps and heat stress maps were developed and used for the comparison analysis. The flood maps produced indicate vulnerable low-lying areas, whereas thermal stress maps indicate open, unshaded areas where high Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) values (thermal comfort) can be expected. The work to date indicates the potential of combining two different kinds of maps to identify and analyse the problem areas. These maps could be further improved and used by urban planners and other stakeholders to assess the resilience and well-being of cities.

Mainly, the exploitation of contextual information in a fixed receptive field is the focus of previous research, which makes it difficult to generically extract buildings that vary greatly in size and shape, especially when isolated large buildings are surrounded by dense small buildings. To improve this problem, we attempt to teach the network to adjust the receptive field and enhance useful feature information adaptively. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive screening feature network (ASF-Net), which can independently screen and enhance effective feature information from two aspects. On the one hand, we propose a deepened space up-sampling block to screen useful information and help establish boundaries. On the other hand, we propose an Adaptive Information Utilization Block (AIUB) to enlarge the receptive field of feature maps and refine the incomplete building footprint. As a result, the more accurate multiscale building footprint is inferred from the enhanced features. Experimental results on the popular aerial image segmentation datasets show that ASF-Net obtains competitive results [80.2% intersection over union (IoU) on the Inria aerial image labeling dataset and 74.2% IoU on the Massachusetts buildings dataset] in comparison with several state-of-the-art models. The TensorFlow implementation is available at https://github.com/jyx0516/ASF-Net.

Parvez			A Gabor Filter-Based Protocol for Automated Image-Based Building Detection	BUILDINGS			English	Article						building detection; aerial image dataset; image processing; local feature extraction	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; OBJECTS	Detecting buildings from high-resolution satellite imagery is beneficial in mapping, environmental preparation, disaster management, military planning, urban planning and research purposes. Differentiating buildings from the images is possible however, it may be a time-consuming or complicated process. Therefore, the high-resolution imagery from satellites needs to be automated to detect the buildings. Additionally, buildings exhibit several different characteristics, and their appearance in these images is unplanned. Moreover, buildings in the metropolitan environment are typically crowded and complicated. Therefore, it is challenging to identify the building and hard to locate them. To resolve this situation, a novel probabilistic method has been suggested using local features and probabilistic approaches. A local feature extraction technique was implemented, which was used to calculate the probability density function. The locations in the image were represented as joint probability distributions and were used to estimate their probability distribution function (pdf). The density of building locations in the image was extracted. Kernel density distribution was also used to find the density flow for different metropolitan cities such as Sydney (Australia), Tokyo (Japan), and Mumbai (India), which is useful for distribution intensity and pattern of facility point f interest (POI). The purpose system can detect buildings/rooftops and to test our system, we choose some crops with panchromatic high-resolution satellite images from Australia and our results looks promising with high efficiency and minimal computational time for feature extraction. We were able to detect buildings with shadows and building without shadows in 0.4468 (seconds) and 0.5126 (seconds) respectively.

One product plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh is made of Banda Aceh as Green City. To realize the Green City Banda Aceh, urban development process should be conducted in a planned and integrated way with attention to spatial and environmental aspects to ensure an efficient urban management and to create a healthy, beautiful and comfortable environment. There is a weakness of the process in urban planning and development that occurred at present where cities tend to minimize the development of green open space and land conversion into a commercial district, residential areas, industrial areas, transport networks and infrastructure and facilities for other cities. Another tendency that occurs is urban environment only developed economically but not ecologically, whereas ecological balance is as important as the development of the economic value of urban areas. Such conditions have caused unbalance of urban ecosystems including increased air temperature, air pollution, declining water table, flooding, salt water intrusion and increased content of heavy metals in the soil. From an ecological perspective, unfavorable microclimate, high-temperature increase due to the lack of trees as a sieve / filter against heavy rain, can cause flooding. These conditions result in inconvienient, arid and less beautiful urban areas. The author identifies the elements contained in the Green City Banda Aceh and how the efforts and approaches must be made toward Green City Banda Aceh.	[Arif, A.

However, the hazard of tsunami depends also on the vulnerability of neighboring structures and hence its hazard and vulnerability should not be assessed separately. The distribution of tsunami height varies so significantly that the traditional definition parallel to that in seismic risk should be modified. Besides, previous studies on the probability of tsunami focused on the occurrence possibility of tsunami hazard in a fixed period of time, but this information is not applicable for a specific tsunami incidence. For the above-mentioned problems, a new algorithm that comprises two components is proposed in the present study. The first component, the Probabilistic Forecast of Tsunami Inundation (PFTI), is the conditional inundation probability once a tsunami of a specific height occurs, or an earthquake is detected at some specific location with a specific magnitude. PFTI comprises the assessments of both tsunami hazard and vulnerability, and can be directly applied to a specific tsunami incidence. The second component treats the Tsunamigenic Earthquake Number (TEN) modified from previous studies on tsunami hazard. These two components are combined to give the inundation possibility in a fixed period of time dubbed Earthquake-induced Tsunami Inundation Probability (ETIP) and the result can be used in urban planning or disaster mitigation guidelines. Application of this methodology to the coast of Taiwan is also discussed.

A critical need arises for effective urban planning for Istanbul in relation to the use of a hybrid approach integrating AHP-Entropy and GIS for emergency facility planning. In this paper, the combination of AHP and Entropy methods was used for evaluating criterion weights subjectively and objectively. These techniques were utilized with regard to the assessment of suitable areas for planning new urban emergency facilities for Istanbul province which experiences increasing urban fire-related emergencies. AHP and Entropy have been used to evaluate the weights of determined criteria from expert preference judgments and GIS for processing, analysis and visualization of the model result in the form of a suitability map for new urban emergency facilities. Validation of the model was performed on the criteria with the strongest influence in the decision outcome and spatially visualized using the sensitivity analysis (SA) method of one-at-a-time (OAT). From the findings, it was estimated that 28.1% of the project area, accounting for a third of it, is likely to be exposed to the risk of urban fires and therefore immediate planning of new urban emergency facilities is recommended for adequate fire service coverage and protection.

Negotiating climate science, adaptation and multi-level governance in India	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENERGY; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES; SYSTEMS; CITIES	As the world's population is expected to be over 2/3(rd) urban by 2050, climate action in cities is a growing area of interest in the inter-disciplines of development policy, disaster mitigation and environmental governance. The climate impacts are expected to be quite severe in the developing world, given its urban societies are densely packed, vastly exposed to natural elements while possessing limited capabilities. There is a notable ambiguity and complexity that inhibits a methodical approach in identifying urban resilience measures. The complexity is due to intersection of large number of distinct variables in climate geoscience (precipitation and temperature anomalies at different locations, RCPs, timeline), adaptation alternatives (approach, priority, intervention level) and urban governance (functional mandate, institutional capacity, and plans & policies). This research examines how disparate and complex knowledge and information in these inter-disciplines can be processed for systematic 'negotiation' to situate, ground and operationalize resilience in cities. With India as a case, we test this by simulating mid-term and long-run climate scenarios (2050 & 2080) to map regional climate impacts that shows escalation in the intensity of climate events like heat waves, urban flooding, landslides and sea level rise.

Key objectives of the project were landslides and floods hazard analysis and the development of guidelines for use in urban planning. This project is also designated as on-going IPL project 161. The aims of the working groups dealing with landslides were to establish a methodology of comprehensive real time monitoring at two most important landslides in Croatia based on the results of previous investigations and new in situ and laboratory testing and behavior analysis; laboratory soil testing and numerical modelling of static and dynamic landslide behavior; development of landslide inventories using direct sensing and remote sensing techniques followed by the development of methodologies of landslide hazard analysis and zonation in three pilot areas in Croatia. In this paper we will present the most important achievements of working groups related to landslide studies at the project pilot areas: two in Primorsko-Goranska County (the Rje'eina River Basin and the Dubrgina River Basin) and one in the City of Zagreb (a hilly area of Medvednica Mt.). The identification and mapping of existing landslides in the hilly area of Medvednica Mt., Dubrgina River Basin and Rje'eina River Basin so as establishment and results of the monitoring systems installed on the Grohovo Landslide and the Kostanjek Landslide will be described.

Existing 3D model of the City of Zagreb, capital of Croatia, was created in the period 2007-2008 based on aerophotogrammetry. It is a vector model consists of Digital Building Model (DBM) and a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). DTM is represented as a triangulated irregular network (TIN). The data were obtained from the photogrammetric mapping of roofs and DTM, defining and measuring the planes of roofs, facades and the ground that together make a 3D city model. The level of details corresponds to LOD 2 according to CityGML standard. 3D city models have become nowadays an increasingly important source of spatial information in different domains. An accurate and well organised 3D model of a city is the principal tool not only for modern urban planning, but also for disaster management, asset management, environmental monitoring, tourism, etc. With the growing interest in 3D modelling, the need for high quality data has arisen. This paper gives the analysis of the data quality of existing 3D model of the City of Zagreb in accordance with the ISO 19157: 2013 Geographic information - Data quality standard. Data quality is being analysed using the defined data quality elements: completeness, logical consistency, positional accuracy, temporal quality, thematic accuracy and usability. Since the original 3D model was created in an old Croatian Coordinate Reference System (CRS), data were also transformed in to the new CRS and stored in CityGML format.

Autonomous adaptive measures are behaviors that the population adopts without explicit planning or the assistance of either institutions, professionals, or both, all of which are focused on protecting themselves from risks. This research focuses near the part of superficial drainage channels, which is divided into five areas. Visits to the study area and interviews with residents allowed to identify urban typologies and autonomous adaptive constructive techniques, as well as the relationship between these forms of adaptation and the socioeconomic conditions of the population. The main results are associated with the main motivations, information and knowledge that support flood adaptation strategies and the consequences of their success or failure in Amazonian cities. Some of them indicates that autonomous flood adaptation measures were not provided with professional technical assistance or externally financed; the measures are associated with structural modifications (e.g., raise the level of the properties and improve the building) and non-structural modifications (e.g., shims). Some of the conclusions are associated with sources of information; community recognition of flood adaptation methods; motivation to the measures implemented autonomously; consequence to the urban planning and people internal migration, and the difficulties to identify and characterize an adaptation measure as proactive or reactive in recurrent flood cycles in Amazonian cities.

District energy network (DEN), current global status and future development	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						District energy network; DEN; District heating and cooling; Urban planning; Global policy	HEATING NETWORK; COOLING SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; THERMAL STORAGE; OPTIMIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; SIMULATION; EXERGY; COGENERATION; BUILDINGS	The conversion of fossil fuel energy into usable and sustainable energy for resilient urban development is the challenge that defines our commitment to our natural habitat. The ever increasing population of the metropolitan area has boosted the demand for energy, on the other hand, the price of traditional fuel sources has shown sharp fluctuations during the past decade, all this is happening at the same time that climate scientist has warren about the near future disaster due to climate change. This situations challenges governments, policy makers and organisations around the world to come up with a solution that is secure, safe, environmentally benign, flexible, renewable and stable. One of the promising technologies that can tackle most of the boxes, is the district energy network. The integrated system can provide required energy, either as electricity, heating or cooling, by utilising available local energy/waste resources. The integrated thermal storage facility would ensure secure and stable access to energy all daytime. A sophisticated and intelligent algorithm that links the potential demand to the supply, using user behaviour analysis and meteorological data ensures the flexibility of the system and defines the next generation of district energy networks (DEN). This work has focused on different district energy network technologies, their applications, configuration, and has extensive information about the existing systems around the world. Finally, the future direction and research gaps are concluded from this review work.

J	Shrestha, S; Vanneschi, L				Shrestha, Sanjeevan; Vanneschi, Leonardo			Improved Fully Convolutional Network with Conditional Random Fields for Building Extraction	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						building extraction; high-resolution aerial imagery; deep convolutional neural network; fully convolutional network; conditional random fields	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; IMAGERY	Building extraction from remotely sensed imagery plays an important role in urban planning, disaster management, navigation, updating geographic databases, and several other geospatial applications. Several published contributions dedicated to the applications of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for building extraction using aerial/satellite imagery exists. However, in all these contributions, high accuracy is always obtained at the price of extremely complex and large network architectures. In this paper, we present an enhanced fully convolutional network (FCN) framework that is designed for building extraction of remotely sensed images by applying conditional random fields (CRFs). The main objective is to propose a methodology selecting a framework that balances high accuracy with low network complexity. A modern activation function, namely, the exponential linear unit (ELU), is applied to improve the performance of the fully convolutional network (FCN), thereby resulting in more accurate building prediction. To further reduce the noise (falsely classified buildings) and to sharpen the boundaries of the buildings, a post-processing conditional random fields (CRFs) is added at the end of the adopted convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. The experiments were conducted on Massachusetts building aerial imagery. The results show that our proposed framework outperformed the fully convolutional network (FCN), which is the existing baseline framework for semantic segmentation, in terms of performance measures such as the F1-score and IoU measure. Additionally, the proposed method outperformed a pre-existing classifier for building extraction using the same dataset in terms of the performance measures and network complexity.

Data fusion has been widely investigated for integrating different source of data in classification of urban area. Thermal infrared imagery (TIR) contains information on emitted radiation and has unique radiometric properties. However, due to coarse spatial resolution of thermal data, its application has been restricted in urban areas. On the other hand, visible image (VIS) has high spatial resolution and information in visible spectrum. Consequently, there is a complementary relation between thermal and visible imagery in classification of urban area. This paper evaluates the potential of aerial thermal hyperspectral and visible imagery fusion in classification of urban area. In the pre-processing step, thermal imagery is resampled to the spatial resolution of visible image. Then feature level fusion is applied to construct hybrid feature space include visible bands, thermal hyperspectral bands, spatial and texture features and moreover Principle Component Analysis (PCA) transformation is applied to extract PCs. Due to high dimensionality of feature space, dimension reduction method is performed. Finally, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classify the reduced hybrid feature space. The obtained results show using thermal imagery along with visible imagery, improved the classification accuracy up to 8% respect to visible image classification.

J	Feres, HG				Gaete Feres, Hector			Long-Term Urban Land Market Trends. Concepcion, Chile. 1989-2018	ACE-ARCHITECTURE CITY AND ENVIRONMENT			Spanish	Article						Urban land market; town planning; urban management and valuation		For 40 years in Chile, the economy has been open, it operates through the free market; the State has played a subsidiary role. In this context, the opacity of the land market constitutes a central problem due to the high risk for the efficient action of urban planning, real estate management, and the provision of housing. Hence, your knowledge is of crucial importance to ensure transparency. On the other hand, regional territories have particularities and common aspects due to their location and local urban management. The case of Gran Concepcion in Chile was studied with data on land offers 1989-2018 and by correlations, the behavior of the variables was reviewed looking for regularities. For trends, it was projected to 2030 through forecasts with the Holt-Winters model. A high association between variables was detected, a consolidated market with a hierarchical urban structure with a downward trend in offers and surface offered, a strong upward trend in prices growing above the results of the economy and its projections. It was evidenced that the configuration of the price is not only due to the action of direct supply and demand, but other components such as the configuration of the "advance price" in the face of government announcements and the "impact price" in the event of disaster nature and due to human action. It was also observed that it is possible to detect the maturity and robustness of the market as soon as the decoupling of key variables such as price occurs, with respect to the supply in quantity and volume.

Influence of Topographic Characteristics on the Adaptive Time Interval for Diffusion Wave Simulation	WATER			English	Article						flood simulation; diffusion wave; time interval; watershed topography; runoff forecasting system	EQUATIONS; MODELS	Frequent flash floods in recent years have resulted in a major impact on the living environment, urban planning, economic system and flood control facilities of residents around the world; therefore, the establishment of disaster management and flood warning systems is an urgent task, required for government units to propose flood mitigation measures. To conserve the numerical accuracy and maintain stability for explicit scheme, the Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) condition is necessarily enforced, and it is conducted to regulate the relation between the numerical marching speed and wave celerity. On the other hand, to avoid the problem of flow reflux between adjacent grids in executing 2D floodplain simulation, another restriction on time intervals, known as the Hunter condition, was devised in an earlier study. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of these two time-interval restrictions during runoff simulations. Via a case study of the Komarovsky River Basin in Russia, the results show that at the beginning of a storm, the computational time interval is restricted by the CFL condition along the upstream steep hillsides, and the time interval is subject to the Hunter condition in the mainstream during the occurrence of the main storm. The reason of a reduction in computational efficiency, which is a common problem in conducting distributed routing, was clearly explained. To relax the time-interval restrictions for efficient flood forecasting, the research findings also indicate the importance of integrating modified hydrological models proposed in recent studies.

J	Alshaikhli, T; Liu, W; Maruyama, Y				Alshaikhli, Tamara; Liu, Wen; Maruyama, Yoshihisa			Simultaneous Extraction of Road and Centerline from Aerial Images Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						multitask learning; deep convolutional neural network; attention gates; aerial images; extraction of road and centerline; simultaneous extraction process; residual blocks	MULTISCALE	The extraction of roads and centerlines from aerial imagery is considered an important topic because it contributes to different fields, such as urban planning, transportation engineering, and disaster mitigation. Many researchers have studied this topic as a two-separated task that affects the quality of extracted roads and centerlines because of the correlation between these two tasks. Accurate road extraction enhances accurate centerline extraction if these two tasks are processed simultaneously. This study proposes a multitask learning scheme using a gated deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to extract roads and centerlines simultaneously. The DCNN is composed of one encoder and two decoders implemented on the U-Net backbone. The decoders are assigned to extract roads and centerlines from low-resolution feature maps. Before extraction, the images are processed within an encoder to extract the spatial information from a complex, high-resolution image. The encoder consists of the residual blocks (Res-Block) connected to a bridge represented by a Res-Block, and the bridge connects the two identical decoders, which consists of stacking convolutional layers (Conv.layer). Attention gates (AGs) are added to our model to enhance the selection process for the true pixels that represent road or centerline classes. Our model is trained on a dataset of high-resolution aerial images, which is open to the public. The model succeeds in efficiently extracting roads and centerlines compared with other multitask learning models.

J	Kohrangi, M; Bazzurro, P; Vamvatsikos, D				Kohrangi, Mohsen; Bazzurro, Paolo; Vamvatsikos, Dimitrios			Seismic risk and loss estimation for the building stock in Isfahan: part II-hazard analysis and risk assessment	BULLETIN OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Urban risk assessment; Earthquake; Isfahan; Iran	PROBABILISTIC EARTHQUAKE LOSS; AVERAGE HORIZONTAL COMPONENT; MOTION PREDICTIVE MODEL; PEAK GROUND MOTION; NGA MODEL; IRAN; PGV; UNCERTAINTY; MITIGATION; SCENARIOS	The second part of a seismic risk assessment study for the Iranian city of Isfahan is presented, focusing on the description of the hazard, the risk analysis, and the discussion of the results. This study utilizes the building exposure model, the fragility and the vulnerability curves illustrated in the companion paper. The earthquake occurrence source model adopted is based on the EMME14 hazard study. The site effects accounting for the soil nonlinear behavior are modeled by means of a Vs(30) map derived from the topographical slope. The validity of this map is tested based on the local surface geology and geotechnical reports. The probabilistic seismic hazard maps for different return periods that account for site effects are generated and compared with the design spectra mandated by the Iranian national seismic design code. In addition, direct seismic monetary and human losses are estimated for two earthquake scenarios and also for 100- and 475-year return periods. We show loss maps and loss curves, offering insights on the most vulnerable building classes and the spatial distribution of the estimated losses. The results provide a basis for pre- and post-disaster emergency planning, for global and local urban planning, as well as for conceiving adequate risk mitigation strategies including devising fair earthquake insurance policies. This study may also serve as a blueprint for carrying out similar work in other urban areas of the Middle East.

J	Rivera, F; Rossetto, T; Twigg, J				Rivera, Felipe; Rossetto, Tiziana; Twigg, John			An interdisciplinary study of the seismic exposure dynamics of Santiago de Chile	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Exposure; Interdisciplinary research; Mixed methods; Seismic risk; Semi-structured interviews; Spatiotemporal dynamics	URBAN	This paper presents an interdisciplinary study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of seismic exposure. Out of the three components of risk-hazard, exposure, and vulnerability-exposure is the least studied, and is commonly treated as being constant in time. This approach neglects the dynamics associated with rapid development and urbanization, misrepresenting exposure in risk assessments. In this paper, mixed research methods are used to understand the dynamics of exposure in Santiago, the capital of Chile, between 1992 and 2017. First, residential exposure is modelled for three epochs using census data and public databases. Then, semi-structured interviews are conducted with local experts in engineering, planning, and disaster risk reduction to unveil the role of earthquake risk information in urban policy and development. Results show a steady expansion and densification of the city over the last 25 years, which is expected to continue in the future. The preferred building material for this growth is reinforced concrete, which rises from 3 to 17% as a proportion of the total structures in the city. It is also found that urban planning policy is disconnected from earthquake risk, which is perceived as a non-issue due to high local compliance with seismic codes. Thus, the continuous growth and homogenization of the built environment creates a singular dependence and blind trust in the local seismic academic and professional communities to provide earthquake resilience through safe buildings. These conditions configure a fragile but highly enabling environment for increasing seismic resilience in the city.

A reliable prediction of the hydrodynamics of flooding events forms an indispensable basis to fulfill these tasks. These predictions can be used during landscape, infrastructure and urban planning phases as well. The 2D-hydrodynamic simulation package Delft Flooding System (Delft-FLS), recently developed at Delft Hydraulics, is specially suited to simulate the dynamic behaviour of overland flow over initially dry land, as well as flooding and drying processes on every kind of geometry, including lowlands and mountain areas. A robust numerical scheme allows for the correct simulation of subcritical and supercritical flow. Internal boundary conditions are included to simulate dam break / dike break events. The main characteristics and features of this package are presented in this paper. Robust numerical techniques are described, for the simulation of shallow water flow, that guarantee positive water levels. Combined with mass conservation this assures a stable numerical solution. Correctness of the solution then depends on certain additional properties as will be shown. These numerical techniques are suitable for practical application, as will be demonstrated by both elementary test problems and by actual simulation of inundation as a result of dam breaks or rising water levels. The flow module is used to determine the flooded area at a GIS grid /pixel level, including the water depth and the inundation period. Damage assessment is possible provided sufficient data of land use and investments are available within a GIS system.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been recently used as a workhorse for effectively generating building footprints. However, to completely exploit the prediction power of CNNs, large-scale pixel-level annotations are required. Most state-of-the-art methods based on CNNs are focused on the design of network architectures for improving the predictions of building footprints with full annotations, while few works have been done on building footprint segmentation with limited annotations. In this article, we propose a novel semisupervised learning method for building footprint segmentation, which can effectively predict building footprints based on the network trained with few annotations (e.g., only 0.0324 km(2) out of 2.25-km(2) area is labeled). The proposed method is based on investigating the contrast between the building and background pixels in latent space and the consistency of predictions obtained from the CNN models when the input RS images are perturbed. Thus, we term the proposed semisupervised learning framework of building footprint segmentation as PiCoCo, which is based on the enforcement of Pixelwise Contrast and Consistency during the learning phase. Our experiments, conducted on two benchmark building segmentation datasets, validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework as compared to several state-of-the-art building footprint extraction and semisupervised semantic segmentation methods.

Engineering Assessment of spatiotemporal patterns of social vulnerability: A tool to resilient urban development Alexandria, Egypt	AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Social vulnerability; Vulnerability frameworks; Urban planning; Resilient development; Disaster risk management		In today's world, most cities face physical threats posed by climate change. These threats create environmental hazards, along with urban problems resulting from rapid urbanization and fast growth of cities. Unplanned urbanization causes the formulation of marginalized urban communities. According to a UnHabitat report (2014), those groups are most vulnerable and most likely to suffer from disasters. The vulnerability of such population is an alarming problem with major social, environmental, and economic consequences. This issue has received significant consideration in climate change and disaster management research. The social vulnerability of communities is attributable to multiple indicators such as high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. This research aims at analysing the social vulnerability of Alexandria city. It reviews and implements several methods for selecting and aggregating vulnerability indicators. This aggregation process that captures multiple aspects of socio-spatial vulnerability in a single index or a small number of variables can produce thematic maps that act as powerful visual tools to identify those areas most susceptible to suffer from environmental changes. This study follows a structured framework to firstly describe the process of developing a social vulnerability index (SoVI), from 14 variables using two different methods. Secondly, it analyses the spatial patterns of the developed composite SoVI at the neighbourhood ``Shyakha" level using ArcMap geographic information systems (GIS). The results demonstrate that the distribution of social vulnerability is not equal along Alexandria city. Most of the city is categorized to have relatively medium vulnerability level, while few areas are regarded as highly vulnerable ``hot spots" and other areas are regarded as low vulnerable ``cold spots". Finally, based on the interpretation of the developed index and the deep examination of the characteristics of those vulnerable areas, the study offers guidelines to promote resilient development of most vulnerable areas.

J	Park, K; Lee, MH				Park, Kiyong; Lee, Man-Hyung			The Development and Application of the Urban Flood Risk Assessment Model for Reflecting upon Urban Planning Elements	WATER			English	Article						climate change; urban flood risk; flood damage; urban disaster; land use	VULNERABILITY; LEVEL	As a city develops and expands, it is likely confronted with a variety of environmental problems. Although the impact of climate change on people has continuously increased in the past, great numbers of natural disasters in urban areas have become varied in terms of form. Among these urban disasters, urban flooding is the most frequent type, and this study focuses on urban flooding. In cities, the population and major facilities are concentrated, and to examine flooding issues in these urban areas, different levels of flooding risk are classified on 100 m x 100 m geographic grids to maximize the spatial efficiency during the flooding events and to minimize the following flooding damage. In this analysis, vulnerability and exposure tests are adopted to analyze urban flooding risks. The first method is based on land-use planning, and the building-to-land ratio. Using fuzzy approaches, the tests focus on risks. However, the latter method using the HEC-Ras model examines factors such as topology and precipitation volume. By mapping the classification of land-use and flooding, the risk of urban flooding is evaluated by grade-scales: green, yellow, orange, and red zones. There are two key findings and theoretical contributions of this study. First, the areas with a high flood risk are mainly restricted to central commercial areas where the main urban functions are concentrated. Additionally, the development density and urbanization are relatively high in these areas, in addition to the old center of urban areas. In the case of Changwon City, Euichang-gu and Seongsan-gu have increased the flood risk because of the high property value of commercial areas and high building density in these regions. Thus, land-use planning of these districts should be designed to reflect upon the different levels of flood risks, in addition to the preparation of anti-disaster facilities to mitigate flood damages in high flood risk areas. Urban flood risk analysis for individual land use districts would facilitate urban planners and managers to prioritize the areas with a high flood risk and to prepare responding preventive measures for more efficient flood management.

The present study, therefore, tried to analyze the slope stability of vulnerable slope using Scheidegger 1970 slope stability method. Moreover, the purpose of the exploration is to find out causes of slope instability, analysis of slope stability intensity and predicting mapping through GIS techniques. Slope stability data are collected from the study area by measuring slope of angle, height and soil texture density. The average height, slope of angle and soil texture density represent 11.26 m, 74.82 degrees and 1.67 g/cm(3), respectively. The weight (W) of the sliding per unit width, 307.01, The component W parallel to the slide surface, The component W that normal the slide surface represent 307.01, 288.6 and, respectively. The average critical height (h(cr)) at which the bank of slope become unstable is 17.63. On the basis of physical environment (geological formation and geomorphological unit, aspects, slope of angle, elevation, soil texture density) the spatial distribution of slope stability parameter intensity are mapping and these helps policy makings, proper urban planning and decision building. This research recommends that along with permanent structure, informal settlements also relocate from the susceptible unstable slope to reduce the vulnerability of landslides hazard. Moreover, under no circumstance the top hills of these areas should not be fixed by concrete structure, so that these hilly areas can operate their own natural geological and geomorphological readjustments. Ensure the protection of existing hills and sounding ecology from the all types of illegal hill cutting. Study comprises development of spatial slope stability intensity zoning map of Khulshi Thana which helps policy makers, engineers, town planners and geologist to build up a rationally geological hazard free safe hilly city.

Park green space (PGS), as an open natural landscape, have become a popular destination for active travel trips in metropolitan areas. Pedestrians and cyclists are often at high crash risk when exposed to complicated traffic environments in urban areas. Therefore, this study aims to propose a safety assessment framework for evaluating active travel traffic safety (ATTS) near PGS from the perspective of urban planning and exploring the effect of the point-of-interest (POI) aggregation phenomenon on ATTS. First, links between ATTS and the environment variables were investigated and integrated into the framework using the catastrophe model. Second, the relationship between the POI density and ATTS was investigated using three spatial regression models. Results in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area as a case study have shown that (1) the population density, road density, nighttime brightness, and vegetation situation near PGS have pronounced effects on ATTS; (2) pedestrians near PGS enjoy safer road facilities than cyclists. Active travel traffic near PGS requires more attention than non-park neighborhoods; (3) among four park categories, using active travel to access theme parks is the safest; and (4) SEM has the best fit for POI cluster research. Increases in leisure facility density and residence density may lead to deterioration and improvement in ATTS safety levels near PGSs, respectively. The safety framework can be applied in other regions because the selected environment indicators are common and accessible. The findings offer appropriate traffic planning strategies to improve the safety of active travel users when accessing PGS.

Although there are many methods, we still lack a deep review of the recent progress concerning the latest deep learning methods in change detection. To this end, the main purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the available deep learning-based change detection algorithms using HR remote sensing images. The paper first describes the change detection framework and classifies the methods from the perspective of the deep network architectures adopted. Then, we review the latest progress in the application of deep learning in various granularity structures for change detection. Further, the paper provides a summary of HR datasets derived from different sensors, along with information related to change detection, for the potential use of researchers. Simultaneously, representative evaluation metrics for this task are investigated. Finally, a conclusion of the challenges for change detection using HR remote sensing images, which must be dealt with in order to improve the model's performance, is presented. In addition, we put forward promising directions for future research in this area.

Inundated cities and the physical damages due to the floods (in buildings, public spaces, etc.), public health and disaster management and emergency acts costs are some kinds of problems due to inadequate urban drainage systems. Rapid population growth, urban development and industrialization of communities increase the acceleration of the problems and provide new problems like sanitary and safety problems, water pollution problems, increasing the flood intensity and flash floods in downstream, decreasing base flow etc. Mitigation measures of urban flood effects and their control will implement through the accurate design of suitable load capacity of drainage networks; consideration of the system's functions as an object lead designers to simulation some different scenarios by models like empirical models, mathematical models or laboratory physical models. This research has simulated one the Tehran sub basins by SWMM, the mathematical model that developed and presented by Environmental Protection Agency of USA (EPA) for modeling the quantity and quality of surface runoff. In this simulation, kinematic wave method (solving flow continuity equation in unsteady state and manning equation) has been applied to flood estimation and surface channelized flow elements was utilized. Flood routing in channels was considered and calculated within dynamic wave method. Final results showed that some zones of drainage system are not efficient; then reparation and adjustment measures presented. Additionally regarding to modeling validated results, SWMM considered as suitable model for simulation of urban runoff in this case study field.

J	He, M; Xu, YM; Li, N				He, Miao; Xu, Yongming; Li, Ning			Population Spatialization in Beijing City Based on Machine Learning and Multisource Remote Sensing Data	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						population spatialization; remote sensing; random forest; Beijing	SURFACE TEMPERATURE RETRIEVAL; NIGHTTIME LIGHTS; URBAN; DISTRIBUTIONS; IMAGERY; LEVEL	Remote sensing data have been widely used in research on population spatialization. Previous studies have generally divided study areas into several sub-areas with similar features by artificial or clustering algorithms and then developed models for these sub-areas separately using statistical methods. These approaches have drawbacks due to their subjectivity and uncertainty. In this paper, we present a study of population spatialization in Beijing City, China based on multisource remote sensing data and town-level population census data. Six predictive algorithms were compared for estimating population using the spatial variables derived from The National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/ Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) night-time light and other remote sensing data. Random forest achieved the highest accuracy and therefore was employed for population spatialization. Feature selection was performed to determine the optimal variable combinations for population modeling by random forest. Cross-validation results indicated that the developed model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2129.52 people/km(2)and a R(2)of 0.63. The gridded population density in Beijing at a spatial resolution of 500 m produced by the random forest model was also adjusted to be consistent with the census population at the town scale. By comparison with Google Earth high-resolution images, the remotely-sensed population was qualitatively validated at the intra-town scale. Validation results indicated that remotely sensed results can effectively depict the spatial distribution of population within town-level districts. This study provides a valuable reference for urban planning, public health and disaster prevention in Beijing, and a reference for population mapping in other cities.

In this work HDR satellite image dataset used for pre-processing purpose. Normally the sky's dynamic range is as large as 10(6):1, while the LDR (Low Dynamic Range) display has a dynamic range of 10(3):1. Therefore, HDR satellite image needs to compress this dynamic range to get LDR image. TMO (Tone Mapping Operator) is used for excellent visualization purposes to solve this issue and has served excellent image quality. Satellite captured images are very large in size, with ordinary display facing difficulties in viewing and understanding the information available in an image. Therefore, the whole image needs to be divided into tiny components with big data, so it helps to comprehend and visualize. To overcome this problem segmentation method is to be used.

Various deep learning models have been proposed to extract building information, showing both strengths and weaknesses in capturing the complex spectral and spatial characteristics of buildings in remote sensing images. To integrate the strengths of individual models and obtain fine-scale spatial and spectral building information, this study proposed a stacking ensemble deep learning model. First, an optimization method for the prediction results of the basic model is proposed based on fully connected conditional random fields (CRFs). On this basis, a stacking ensemble model (SENet) based on a sparse autoencoder integrating U-NET, SegNet, and FCN-8s models is proposed to combine the features of the optimized basic model prediction results. Utilizing several cities in Hebei Province, China as a case study, a building dataset containing attribute labels is established to assess the performance of the proposed model. The proposed SENet is compared with three individual models (U-NET, SegNet and FCN-8s), and the results show that the accuracy of SENet is 0.954, approximately 6.7%, 6.1%, and 9.8% higher than U-NET, SegNet, and FCN-8s models, respectively. The identification of building features, including colors, sizes, shapes, and shadows, is also evaluated, showing that the accuracy, recall, F1 score, and intersection over union (IoU) of the SENet model are higher than those of the three individual models. This suggests that the proposed ensemble model can effectively depict the different features of buildings and provides an alternative approach to building extraction with higher accuracy.

Since 2005, the area has experienced more than two dozen hurricanes with major rainstorms in between. Cemeteries, although just as vulnerable to storms and cancer-causing chemicals as the local population and natural environment, are overlooked casualties of frequent hurricanes and plant siting. During hurricanes and annual flooding, cemeteries in South Louisiana sustain significant damage such as dislodged coffins, difficult to reintern remains, and burial records damaged or destroyed. African American cemeteries are vulnerable to climate change impacts such as flooding, are often inaccessible, undocumented, and rarely recognized as environmental justice concerns, until now. Recently, environmental justice activists have mobilized to resist a Formosa plant's siting close to a historic black cemetery in St James Parish. The authors hypothesized that the Formosa siting is not an isolated case but instead reflects a pattern of racialized multihazard exposure of African American people and cemeteries. They created a database of cemetery locations-many of which were previously unmapped-based on the race or ethnicity of those interred in two parishes. Then, they performed a spatial analysis comparing cemeteries' exposure to flood hazards and proximity to hazardous chemical sites based on racial makeup. Findings show that black cemeteries have more multihazard exposure than other cemeteries due to accessibility and flooding. Results indicate that racialized multihazard exposure of cemeteries should be an emerging concern of Gulf Coast disaster recovery planners and researchers.

J	Wang, LY; Fan, H; Wang, YK				Wang, Luyao; Fan, Hong; Wang, Yankun			Improving population mapping using Luojia 1-01 nighttime light image and location-based social media data	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Population mapping; Luojia 1-01 image; Point of interest; Check-in data; Attraction degree	SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; DENSITY; CHINA; INFORMATION; PREDICTION	Fine-resolution population mapping, which is vital to urban planning, public health, and disaster management, has gained considerable attention in socioeconomic and environmental studies. Although population distribution has been considered highly correlated with urban facilities, the quantitative relationship between the two has yet to be revealed when considering huge heterogeneity. To address this problem, the present study proposed a novel population mapping method by adopting Luojia 1-01 nighttime light imagery, points of interest (POI), and social media check-in data. A grid-based attraction degree (AD) model was built to quantify the possibility of population concentration in each geographic unit with a comprehensive consideration of the distribution and the popularity of facilities. On the basis of kernel density estimation, 16 attraction indexes were extracted by matching POI and check-in data. Multiple variables were used to train a random forest model, through which fine-scale population mapping was conducted in Zhejiang, China. The comparison between demographic and WorldPop data proved the high accuracy of our approach (R-2 = 0.75 and 0.58). To explore the characteristics of the model further, the most appropriate search distance (650 m) and acquisition time (19:00-08:00) of the check-in data were discussed. The contrast experiment revealed that the model could outperform those from previous studies on rural and suburban areas with a few check-in points and low AD; thus, the mapping error caused by heterogeneity considerably decreased. The results indicated the proposed method has great potential in fine-scale population mapping. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, KN; Chen, YH; Li, Y				Li, Kangning; Chen, Yunhao; Li, Ying			The Random Forest-Based Method of Fine-Resolution Population Spatialization by Using the International Space Station Nighttime Photography and Social Sensing Data	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Random Forest Regression; ISS photography; urban functional zones; point of interest; social sensing data; population spatialization	SATELLITE IMAGERY; LAND-COVER; LIGHT DATA; DENSITY; CHINA; CENSUS; SCALE; EMISSIONS; CITY	Despite the importance of high-resolution population distribution in urban planning, disaster prevention and response, region economic development, and improvement of urban habitant environment, traditional urban investigations mainly focused on large-scale population spatialization by using coarse-resolution nighttime light (NTL) while few efforts were made to fine-resolution population mapping. To address problems of generating small-scale population distribution, this paper proposed a method based on the Random Forest Regression model to spatialize a 25 m population from the International Space Station (ISS) photography and urban function zones generated from social sensing datapoint-of-interest (POI). There were three main steps, namely HSL (hue saturation lightness) transformation and saturation calibration of ISS, generating functional-zone maps based on point-of-interest, and spatializing population based on the Random Forest model. After accuracy assessments by comparing with WorldPop, the proposed method was validated as a qualified method to generate fine-resolution population spatial maps. In the discussion, this paper suggested that without help of auxiliary data, NTL cannot be directly employed as a population indicator at small scale. The Variable Importance Measure of the RF model confirmed the correlation between features and population and further demonstrated that urban functions performed better than LULC (Land Use and Land Cover) in small-scale population mapping. Urban height was also shown to improve the performance of population disaggregation due to its compensation of building volume. To sum up, this proposed method showed great potential to disaggregate fine-resolution population and other urban socio-economic attributes.

The purpose of this study was to determine the fire safety risk score of commercial complexes and its related factors. Material and method: The commercial complexes of area 1 of District 12 of Tehran were studied. The characteristics of the complexes, including construction, height, activity, Occupancy Coefficient and etc in each complex were collected. Fire risk assessment was performed using NFPA101 standard and CFSES software in three areas of control, Egress and general safety. In SPSS software version 21, linear regression and ANOVA tests were used to determine the relationship between variables. Results: Of the 79 commercial complexes studied, only 8 in control area and 4 in general area achieved acceptable risk level. None of them achieved an acceptable score in the Egress. According to the results, there was no significant relationship between risk levels and height, type and activity Coefficient of them (p>0.05). However, between Occupancy Coefficient of complexes with fire safety risk levels of control (p<0.001) and genera l(p = 0.013) and between construction with all risk levels ((p Egress = 0.004), (p Control & p General<0.001)) There was a significant relationship. Conclusion: The results showed the current situation of the studied commercial complexes is prone to cause a disaster in the 12th district of Tehran; Using the results of this study in urban planning and cross-sectoral communication to improve the safety of commercial complexes in the region is suggested.

When tropical storms and hurricanes occur where coastal wetlands have undergone land use change (LUC), socioeconomic disaster results. Our objective was to estimate the economic value of flood prevention service provided by coastal wetlands. We quantified LUC and the loss of water retention capacity as a wetlands loss function and estimated the economic cost of flooding to households (lost appliances). The Veracruz-Boca del Rio-Medellin conurbation in Veracruz, Mexico, was used to evaluate these parameters during the floods caused by hurricane Karl in 2010. The total economic cost of losses to households was $150.85 million USD/2007. Between 1980 and 2010, the urban zone grew by 1,437.41 ha, resulting in the loss of 16.34 ha of water bodies, 455.41 ha of agriculture, and 965.66 ha of coastal wetlands (25.36 ha of mangroves, 152.95 ha of freshwater marshes and 787.35 ha of flooded grasslands). These results were used to obtain the economic value of flood prevention service and expressed as indirect-avoided cost. The economic values of flood prevention were: flooded grassland at $148,277 USD/ha/2007, freshwater broad-leaved marsh at $190,863 USD/ha/2007, and mangroves at $193,674 USD/ha/2007. The results of this study highlight the importance of protecting coastal wetlands and can be used by urban planning decision-makers when drawing up public policies in regional coastal contexts to protect human settlements and infrastructure.

Xuzhou City, located in northwest Jiangsu Province, China, is chosen as the study area, and two scenes of China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellites images and one scene of HJ-1 image are employed to estimate ISA percentage and analyze the change trend from 2001 to 2009. Using a linear spectral mixture model (LSMM) and nonlinear backpropagation neural network (BPNN) method, all pixels are decomposed to derive four fraction images representing the abundance of four endmembers: vegetation, high-albedo objects, low-albedo objects, and soil. The ISA percentage is then derived by the combination of high-and low-albedo fraction images after removing the influence of water. Some high spatial resolution images are selected to validate the ISA estimation results, and the experimental results indicate that the accuracy of BPNN is higher than LSMM. By comparing the urban ISA abundances derived by BPNN from three dates, it is found that the ISA of Xuzhou City has increased rapidly from 2001 to 2009, especially in the northeast and southeast regions, corresponding to the urban planning scheme and fast urbanization. Compared to other medium remote sensing images, the revisit cycle of HJ-1 multispectral image is only two days, demonstrating the potential of such data for ISA extraction in urbanization, disaster, and other related applications.

Although TM image has got wide applications, its use in mining area is still in experiment and beginning stage because mining area is a kind of special and complex geographic region. One of the most important issues is to study the information characteristics and determine the most effective band combinations oriented to given region and task.. In this paper, Xuzhou mining area, located in Northern Jiangsu Province, is taken as the studying area, and Terrestrial Surface Evolution (TSE) as the studying task. According to the specific condition of studying area, the information characteristics of each band of TM image and relations between different bands are analyzed by selecting different sampling area, and relative rules are given. After that, band combination is discussed and the information content is used as the judging rule. Because-more bands will require more computer resource and is low speed and cost consuming, three-band combination is used widely. It is found that in all three-band combination schemes, the combination of Band 3, Band 4 and Band 5 is the most effective. Finally, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to the band selection in multi-band RS image, and it proved that GA is an effective method to determine the optimal band combination, especially for multi-spectrum and super-spectrum RS information source, and GA is also a good optimized algorithm in Geoscience.

However, it is difficult to determine the corresponding surface positions in the city environment for noise and building restrictions. The active source reflection seismic technique is considered the best technique to image faults with a high resolution and deep penetration. However, urban geophysical exploration must often consider the complex urban environment, which includes moving vehicles, dense power grids, and irregular buildings. These features make active source reflection seismic exploration difficult for wide application due to its drawbacks of high cost and the necessary use of explosives. In contrast, ambient noise seismic surveys have the advantages of continuous ambient noise sources, low cost, and fast deployment. These advantages are good for urban exploration. Although ambient noise seismic surveys have a lower resolution than active seismic surveys, their ultrahigh-density layout can improve the resolution. We have conducted two active source seismic lines and two ambient noise seismic lines near the Huangzhuang-Gaoliying fault (HGF) in a northern suburb of Beijing. The autocorrelation and crosscorrelation results are consistent with the active source reflection seismic results. They revealed the location of the HGF, which is composed of a set of steep dip faults. The study of the combination of the two techniques demonstrates that ambient noise seismic surveys are effective for urban active fault detection, especially for larger scale area surveys, and active source reflection seismic surveys can be used for detailed surveys. The combination of the two techniques has a higher efficiency and lower costs and can be widely used in blind urban active fault surveys.

Due to the facility and less dependence on the site environment, noise-based technique is an ideal way to acquire the fine structure of urban sedimentary basin. Based on the dense array composed of more than 900 stations deployed in Tongzhou at a local scale of 20 x 40 km(2), we prove that the lateral variation of the phase velocity of multimode surface waves can be estimated directly with sufficient accuracy by beamforming seismic noise with moving subarrays. Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps, at frequencies between 0.3 and 2.5 Hz for the fundamental mode as well as 0.8 and 3.0 Hz for the first overtone, are obtained. The 3D S wave velocity model at 0-1-km depth with lateral resolution of 1 km is then established by inverting phase velocity maps of the two modes. The sediment thickness is delineated by the impedance interface given by microtremor H/V (horizontal-to-vertical) spectral ratio. The proposed model is in good agreement with the distribution of tectonic units. The sediment thickness of Daxing high and two sags around Gantang and Xiadian are, respectively, 100-400 and 400-600 m, which correlates well with the 1 km/s isosurface of S wave velocity. The model presents some evidence on the extension of Daxing fault along NE direction.

J	Ali, A; Kim, KY				Ali, Abid; Kim, Ki Young			Comparative analyses of seismic site conditions and microzonation of the major cities in Gangwon Province, Korea	EXPLORATION GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						microzonation; Rayleigh wave; seismic amplification; seismic site condition; Vs(30)	SHEAR-WAVE VELOCITY; STRONG-MOTION; EARTHQUAKE; NOISE; INVERSION; HAZARD; DEPTH; BASIN; PROXY	To determine the seismic site conditions and microzonation of Chuncheon, Wonju and Gangneung cities in the Gangwon Province, Korea, the dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves were derived at 313 sites by the extended spatial autocorrelation (ESPAC) method. Using the shear-wave velocities (Vs) determined from dispersion curves, average depth to the bedrock (D-b) and Vs at the top of the bedrock (Vs(b)), the overburden layer (Vs(o)) and the top 30 m depth layer (Vs(30)) were determined. The resonance frequencies (f(r)) were then computed using both Db and Vs(o). The estimated averages of the three cities were 13 +/- 7m for Db, 472 +/- 109 m/s for Vsb, 248 +/- 44 m/s for Vs(o), 411 +/- 157m/s for Vs(30) and 5.8 +/- 2.8Hz for f(r). Microzonation maps based on the proxy-based Vs30 indicated that the three cities were mainly categorised into National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) classes B, C and D, with a minor proportion of A. Although no area was estimated to be in class E using the proxy-based Vs(30), the Vs(30) values derived from the recorded Rayleigh waves at 13 sites in Gangneung were less than 180m/s. This indicates a greater vulnerability to seismic amplification during large earthquakes in this city, which had the smallest Vs(o), Vs(30) and f(r), and the greatest D-b of the three cities. Microzonation maps, together with information for f(r), can be effectively used for seismic risk assessments, urban planning, and disaster management.

In the last two decades, a large variety of methods on automatic building detection have been proposed in the remote sensing literature. Many of these approaches make use of local features to classify each pixel or segment to an object label, therefore involving an extra step to fuse pixelwise decisions. This paper presents a generic framework that exploits recent advances in image segmentation and region descriptors extraction for the automatic and accurate detection of buildings on aerial orthophotos. The proposed solution is supervised in the sense that appearances of buildings are learnt from examples. For the first time in the context of building detection, we use the matrix covariance descriptor, which proves to be very informative and compact. Moreover, we introduce a principled evaluation that allows selecting the best pair segmentation algorithm-region descriptor for the task of building detection. Finally, we provide a performance evaluation at pixel level using different classifiers. This evaluation is conducted over 200 buildings using different segmentation algorithms and descriptors. The performance analysis quantifies the quality of both the image segmentation and the descriptor used. The proposed approach presents several advantages in terms of scalability, suitability and simplicity with respect to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme (detection chain and evaluation) can be deployed for detecting multiple object categories that are present in images and can be used by intelligent systems requiring scene perception and parsing such as intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle navigation and automatic 3D city modeling.

Rainfall occurs in a region, and within that region nearby locations are likely to experience similar impacts due to spatial dependence. While univariate extreme value models provide the easiest statistical modelling approach to rainfall extremes, practitioners and researchers adopting statistical models without spatial dependence are liable to underestimate potential impacts. To minimise the adverse impacts of extreme rainfall, an understanding of the extreme precipitation field is required. To highlight how a spatial model with dependence compares with univariate models of extremes, a max-stable model is fitted to the daily annual maximum rainfall in a case study region of South East Queensland, Australia. This case study region was selected as it can be used to illustrate how climate drivers, such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), can affect the extreme precipitation field and subsequently the distribution of spatial random variables. In adopting a max-stable model it is possible to produce simulations of the daily annual maximum rainfall field. These simulations can be used to inform urban planning strategies. This includes showing that the probability of a historical flash flood occurring was much higher given the strong La Nina phase of ENSO compared with an El Nino phase. The results presented aim to shift the dialogue from a univariate discussion to a discussion about how models of spatial extremes with dependence can be used to better understand the probability of extreme rainfall events and account for the influence of ENSO.

The paper is based on a three stage hybrid policy-making cycle: (i) agenda setting; (ii) policy formulation; and (iii) policy implementation stage, where the contributions of EbA can horizontally (on the ground) or vertically (strategic stage) be mainstreamed and integrated. A total of nine national and sectoral development and climate change policies, and 329 climate change adaptation projects are examined belonging to different policy-making stages. The major findings include that the role of ESS is marginally considered as an adaptation component in most of the reviewed policies, especially at the top strategic level (vertical mainstreaming). However, at the policy formulation and implementation stage (horizontal mainstreaming), they are largely ignored and priority is given to structural adaptation policies and projects, e.g., large scale concrete dams and embankments. For example, ESS's roles to adapt sectors such as urban planning, biodiversity management and disaster risk reduction are left unchecked, and the implementation stage receives overwhelming priorities and investments to undertake hard adaptation measures such that only 38 projects are related to EbA. The paper argues that: (i) dominant structural adaptation ideologies; (ii) the expert and bureaucracy dependent policy making process; and (iii) the lack of adaptive and integration capacities at institutional level are considerably offsetting the EbA mainstreaming process that need to be adequately addressed for climate change adaptation.

Although the concept of resilience has been investigated from different perspectives, the lack of understanding of its conceptual comprehensive aspects presents strong limitations for spatial planning and for the adoption of policies and programs for its measurement and achievement. In this paper, we refer to territorial resilience as an emerging concept capable of aiding the decision-making process of identifying vulnerabilities and improving the transformation of socio-ecological and technological systems (SETSs). Here, we explore the epistemology of resilience, reviewing the origins and the evolution of this term, providing evidence on how this conceptual umbrella is used by different disciplines to tackle problem-solving that arises from disaster management and command-control practices to augment the robustness. Assuming the SETSs paradigm, the seismic and structural engineering, social sciences and history, urban planning and climatology perspectives intersects providing different analytical levels of resilience, including vulnerability and patrimony from a community and cultural perspective. We conclude that territorial resilience surpasses the analytical barriers between different disciplines, providing a useful concept related to complex problem-solving phenomena for land use planning, opening a new research question: how can territorial resilience be measured, acknowledging different units and levels of analysis aiding decision-making in spatial plans and projects? In attempting to understand a resilient system, quantitative and qualitative measurements are crucial to supporting planning decisions.

Population data used in these studies are typically aggregated at census enumeration units, which are too coarse for many applications. Accurate population downscaling methods are needed to obtain population data at finer spatial resolutions. We use a novel settlement-related database, Built-Up Property Records (BUPR) from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the United States (HISDAC-US) to downscale population from census tracts to block groups. The BUPR dataset provides the number of built-up property records for each 250-m grid at 5-year temporal resolution from 1810 to 2015 for most contiguous United States (CONUS). The ability of BUPR to downscale population from census tracts to block groups for four states, representing a range of population densities, is evaluated here by comparing against other commonly-used ancillary datasets. The BUPR-based method outperforms all other methods in all but one state with highly-incomplete BUPR. A more detailed accuracy assessment is performed by dividing each state into low, medium, and high population density categories. The BUPR method produces more accurate downscaled population estimates for low and medium categories, though its performance deteriorates in the high density category due to its relatively coarse spatial resolution. BUPR-based dasymetric mapping is subsequently applied to the CONUS and found to generalize well beyond the four comparison states with high downscaling accuracy. The long-term record of the HISDAC-US dataset enables the potential construction of fine-grained population data back to 1810.

Planning for a resilient urban food system: A case study from Baltimore City, Maryland	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Food System; Resilience; Urban Planning; Climate Change Adaptation; Food Systems Planning; Food Security; Emergency Food Assistance; Food Policy; Case Studies; Northeastern States		Many natural and non-natural hazards threaten food security, especially in urban areas where growing populations place extra demands on the food supply. Ensuring stable food security before, during, and after disasters requires resilient food systems that can withstand and recover from disruptions. However, few U.S. cities have considered food systems in disaster preparedness or resilience planning. This reflective case study from the participant-observer perspective examines the process and outcomes of a city-university collaboration to assess and begin to improve the resilience of Baltimore City's food system. An academic center and municipal department of planning partnered to assess and plan for short- and long-term food system resilience. An Emergency Food Working Group convened for three meetings over three months, resulting in the creation of an emergency food access protocol for acute event response. A broader Baltimore Food System Resilience Advisory Report was then developed based on 36 key-informant interviews with food system stakeholders, literature reviews, and geographic information system (GIS) mapping. That report included an assessment of the Baltimore City food system's vulnerability to hazards, the extent of stakeholder preparedness for food supply disruptions, and identified opportunities for enhancing long-term food system resilience. It presented policy recommendations for Baltimore and a framework for conceptualizing food system vulnerabilities. Policy recommendations and lessons learned from this planning process can serve as an example for other cities interested in enhancing the resilience of their food system or broadening the scope of their resilience planning.

Automatic extraction of building boundaries from high resolution images with active contour segmentation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Active Contour; Automatic; Building Extraction; High Resolution Image		Building extraction from remotely sensed images plays an important role in many applications such as updating geographical information system, change detection, urban planning, disaster management and 3D building modeling. Automatic extraction of buildings from aerial images is not an easy task because of background complexity, lighting conditions and vegetation cover that reduces separability or visibility of buildings. As a result, automatic building extraction can be a complex process for computer vision and image processing techniques. In order to overcome this difficulty region-based active contour model was used to automatically detect the boundary of buildings for this study. To extract object boundaries, the model grows or shrinks the initial contour in the image. The main objective of this paper is making active contours algorithm perform without user interaction and to detect automatically initial contours to segment buildings with a software coded in Matlab. This task carried out by morphological operations, band ratio and thresholding methods. In this study, high resolution aerial images with 8 cm ground sampling distance (GSD) were used. Three separate test zones were selected with varying building level of detail on these images. Finally, it was assessed the accuracy of segmented buildings using Correctness, Completeness and Quality metrics by comparing the results images and manually digitized reference image. The proposed approach for building extraction from images was shown to be 98% accurate on buildings with simple geometry and homogeneous roof textures. However accuracy of extracted buildings with heterogeneous roof textures and lighting, and complex geometry is 89%. The results clearly show that automatically calculated initial contour positions work in accordance with the active contour algorithm and easily extraction of the buildings boundaries.

J	Serief, C				Serief, Chahira			Estimate of the effect of micro-vibration on the performance of the Algerian satellite (Alsat-1B) imager	OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Optical imaging systems; Earth observation satellites; Micro-vibration; Modulation transfer function	OPTICAL TRANSFER-FUNCTIONS; MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS; NUMERICAL-CALCULATION	Alsat-1B, launched into a 670 km sun-synchronous orbit on board the PSLV launch vehicle from the Sriharikota launch site in India on 26 September 2016, is a medium resolution Earth Observation satellite with a mass of 100 kg. Alsat-1B will be used for agricultural and resource monitoring, disaster management, land use mapping and urban planning. It is based on the SSTL-100 platform, and flies a 24 m multispectral imager and a 12 m panchromatic imager delivering images with a swath width of 140 km. One of the main factors affecting the performance of satellite-borne optical imaging systems is micro vibration. Micro-vibration is a low level mechanical disturbance inevitably generated from moving parts on a satellite and exceptionally difficult to be controlled by the attitude and orbital control system (AOCS) of a spacecraft. Micro-vibration usually causes problems for optical imaging systems onboard Earth Observation satellites. The major effect of micro-vibration is the excitation of the support structures for the optical elements during imaging operations which can result in severe degradation of image quality by smearing and distortion. Quantitative characterization of image degradation caused by micro vibration is thus quite useful and important as part of system level analysis which can help preventing micro-vibration influence by proper design and restoring the degraded image. The aim of this work is to provide quantitative estimates of the effect of micro-vibration on the performance of Alsat-1B imager, which may be experienced operationally, in terms of the modulation transfer function (MTF) and based on ground micro-vibration tests results.
